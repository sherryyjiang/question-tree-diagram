Okay, got it. 
M
Mariana D
00:25
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:25
Nice to meet you. I'm Sherry. I'll do just a quick intro on my side. I'm doing research for Peak and we're looking to understand how people who are just a few years, like I guess after graduating college are making decisions around money and other kind of adult decisions. And this interview is meant to firstly get to know a little bit more about kind of your, I guess like thought processes and decisions that you made for yourself. And the second part of it, we'll be going over a few different apps that you'll be trying out to just give feedback. Any questions before we get started? 
M
Mariana D
01:09
No, I don't think so. Okay, cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:12
So first question, just tell me a little bit more about yourself. So you live in Massachusetts. What do you currently do there? And like how old are you? 
M
Mariana D
01:22
All of that. So I'm currently 21 years old and right now I'm at university. I just transferred over because I just graduated with my associates. So I'm now going to in human resources program. So I'll get my diploma in that and then from there, you know, get my a job either as a generalist or maybe a recruiter. I'm not sure yet. I'm still like trying to decide. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:46
Got it. How many more years until you graduate your program? 
M
Mariana D
01:52
So if I go a fast pace, I could finish within a year, but if I take it like gradual, probably like two years. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:01
Okay, gotcha. 
M
Mariana D
02:02
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:03
And what made you want to go into his human resources as a career? 
M
Mariana D
02:09
Well, I actually had like an internship last semester and I was just like testing different business things out and I just like the environment and I was just like very like, you know, they get like a bad rep. And I was like, they're actually like so nice here and they're like not looking like bad into the company. Not trying to be like, you know, evil. Like they're actually like good people behind the scenes. And it kind of like made me think like, oh, maybe I could do this one day and like try to put more good into the world. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:35
Yeah, that's a really nice thought. And were you from the east coast or like Massachusetts area or did you like move there specifically for the program? 
M
Mariana D
02:49
No, I've always been here. I've been here since I was born here. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:55
Yeah, in the Same city or like, you've, you kind of been around? 
M
Mariana D
02:59
I mean, I moved once, but, like, it's like, still within the same, like, county, so it's like. Yeah, I move like, what, 20 minutes away? Like, that's really nothing. That's basically it. I'm still within the same, like, area. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:11
Got it, got it. And right now are you staying, like, with family? On your own roommates? 
M
Mariana D
03:19
Family. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:21
Okay, got it. And what are some things that you like to do for fun, like, outside of, like, I guess, studies, I guess. 
M
Mariana D
03:30
I feel like video games because it's just like, I don't know, maybe it's just a mind generation thing. I just like playing video games. Like, I just like, I, I, I feel like in the winter, like no one here wants to go out. It's just cold. We just want to sit at home. Like, it's snowing. Like, I'm good. Like, I am not leaving my house. Like, I'm just gonna play video games and I'm gonna call it a day. Like, yeah, like summer maybe. Like going out with friends, going to the beach, going and doing whatever. But no, it's cold. I'm not leaving the house. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:57
Yeah, there's good beaches in Mass. 
M
Mariana D
03:59
I mean, maybe they're. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:00
I'm California, so I, Yeah, I, I don't know as much about, I guess, beaches in the east coast, but there are some in Massachusetts, I'm guessing. 
M
Mariana D
04:09
Yeah, I mean, a lot of them are, like, down in, like, Cape Coddish or like, they have local beach towns, but they're like, really, like, gross and contaminated. Like you can't really go to them or like, I live, like, very close to, like, the Mass. Rhode island line. So I usually go into Rhode island beaches, like, very easily because I'm closer there than I am to Boston. You know what I mean? 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:31
Yeah, got it. 
M
Mariana D
04:33
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:33
Yeah. South Summer sounds nice, though, I guess. Do you play, like, is like computer video games or like. 
M
Mariana D
04:42
No. Like, you know, like Station? Yeah. Like, I'm more like a Nintendo, like, Switch. Like, you know, like my little, like, Kirby games. Or maybe I'll play like, Animal Crossing, but it's just like. Nah, I just. No, I know my boyfriend likes to play, like, PlayStation games and stuff. And I'm like, oh, I don't, I don't understand this. This is too complicated for me. Like, I don't. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:03
Yeah, I want something like, more fun and chill. Yeah, yeah, got it. And so currently, I guess when it comes to, like, spending Right. Because this is an app about spending money. I'm wondering, do you currently. Do you currently, I guess earn an income on the side or is your spending based on, I guess, support you're getting elsewhere? Like how does that. Actually so for me usually like they. 
M
Mariana D
05:36
Have like federal like you know, the work study programs and like other like on site jobs. So when the semester starts is when I work on campus doing whatever they decide to do. It just, it changes every semester and it depends on every department. You might stay in the same department or they might move you around. So I have no idea yet. They haven't told me. But it's usually you work on campus, you know, student center, library, whatever. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:59
Yeah, okay, gotcha. Makes sense. I guess right now is. Has school started again? It's. I guess it's Jan, just like towards. 
M
Mariana D
06:13
Yeah. So I still like have a week and a half ish before I go back. I go back next week. But a lot of like colleges around have started. It just, it really just depends on the college. Yeah, my sister starts in like two to three days and like I'm not until another week. It just, it really depends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:31
Got it, got it. Makes sense. So I guess like when you're on campus, right. Where would you say you are spending most of your money if you have to like look at like the different areas? 
M
Mariana D
06:44
I guess like maybe on food. But like I really like, sometimes I'll just be like I go to class and I go home. Like I really don't spend too much money on campus, just me. I know everyone's different, but it probably would be like maybe if I'm really hungry and I didn't bring lunch that day, I'll get something at like the dining hall, but usually. No. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:06
Would you say that you would like, I guess pack your own lunches, usually cook, like prepare that stuff? 
M
Mariana D
07:13
Yeah, pack or cook or maybe I'll grab something like cheap around. But not yet. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:23
Got it. And if you think about like, I guess the last three, like last few. 
M
Mariana D
07:28
Things that you spent money on that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:29
Like I guess made you really happy or you thought was really worth it. What would some of those be. 
M
Mariana D
07:38
Recently? Yeah, I mean in December I went to visit my family in Florida. So I like, I just like bought like a little souvenir. So I guess that probably made me happy. But like I'm trying to. Other than that, I don't know. Like I don't. I'm not like a coffee girl. Like I really don't drink coffee like that. Maybe like I went and got Like a sweet treat or something. But like I think I would just say like recently I think it was souvenirs because pasta, I really don't, I can't remember off the top of my head. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:13
When you say you like get like a sweet treat, is it like a, you go to get like a. I don't know why donuts pop to my head. Maybe I'm just drinking them right now. 
M
Mariana D
08:27
Like what was. I mean, like me, I like there's like this thing at Target, there's like a raspberry chocolate covered like I, I don't know, I guess they're kind of like candies but they're really good. So maybe I'll like, I usually go to Target and be like, what am I craving? Like, do I want just like a little thing cookies? Do I want like ice cream? And I'll just pick something up like a sweet treat. Like maybe I'll go into Starbucks and get a cake pop. But like it really just depends on my mood. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:53
Yeah, got it. So it sounds like you are pretty disciplined when it comes to I guess spending money. 
M
Mariana D
08:59
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:01
Yeah. Is there, is there anything that you spent on like that you've, I guess recently that you felt like you regretted or. That doesn't really come, I guess happen very often. 
M
Mariana D
09:12
I mean not regretted really. Like it kind of like, I guess my parking pass like hurt. Like it wasn't a regret. Like I needed to. Yeah, pass. But I was like, oh, that kind of like hurt it a little. Like that hurt my soul. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:26
Oh. Like is it like a one day parking pass type of thing or you have something over long term? 
M
Mariana D
09:33
Yeah, it's long term for like the semester. But I was like, oh, I, like I, I didn't really want to drop like 250 on that. But like I, I keep, I do what I gotta do. Like it's just, it hurts. Like I guess it's regretting but like you have to. So it's just like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:50
Yeah, yeah, got it. Let's see. That's, that's actually it in terms of the I starting questions. I'm going to have you play around with an app. Basically it's going to. So there's two parts to this. So the first part is just a app to play around with that has like fake data. You're just like interacting with it. The second part, I'm wondering, do you have a, do you have like a bank statement and like a chatgpt at hand? 
M
Mariana D
10:32
I can Pull up a bank statement. Hold on, let me see. I don't know if you prefer a credit card statement because I like, usually just use my bank to pay bills. I'm just. I don't know if you prefer whichever. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:46
One has more, like, spending, like, yeah. 
M
Mariana D
10:48
I'll give you my credit card statement because that, yeah, definitely has more for this. Like, oh, I don't even know if this period is even here yet. Hold on. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:56
Yeah, you could actually probably use one when you're on campus if it's more representative. Because, like, I know sometimes, like when we're home, like, it's not really like that. It doesn't really reflect our life and. Or like, I guess normal day to day. 
M
Mariana D
11:13
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:14
So something from like November, maybe October. 
M
Mariana D
11:19
Let me see. Do. Yeah, we can do that. I'll do October. Let me open it. Do you want me to just send it to your email? I don't know what you prefer. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:35
Oh, yeah. 
M
Mariana D
11:36
Do you have. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:37
Do you have like, chatgpt? Oh, yeah, yeah. So you can just run this prompt. 
M
Mariana D
11:47
Let me see. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:54
Hold one second. 
M
Mariana D
11:56
No, you're good. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:04
So basically run this prompt in GPT plus, like a statement, and it basically extracts some, like, summaries, and then we'll just kind of go through and like, see your reactions to things and then we can move to the other app. Yeah, if you can present your screen when you're going through it, that would be great. 
M
Mariana D
12:23
Okay, let me see. Do. Oh, can we copy this again? Oh, there we go. Just open this it. Okay. And now you just got to put my statement. Got to send it. Hold on. There we go. Okay, I'm just attaching it. Hold on. Because it's on my phone. Good. There we go. Did it not download? Okay, There it is. Okay, while that generates. Let me share my screen. Okay, so here. Where did it go? Oh, here it is. There we go. I think you can see. Hopefully. Yes. Okay, so basically, strictly on transactions and statement. Total spend. TJ Maxx. Most frequent CVS do. Cvs, cvs, Pharmacy, Amazon. I don't know, like, if you just want me to read them out or you just want to. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:32
Yeah, just like read through it first and then I have probably some questions. 
M
Mariana D
16:37
All right. Groceries, 10, coffee, 14 dining. Restaurants, 42. Do food regularly. No activity. Top, largest. Let me see. Shopping, dining, shopping. Amazon, whatnot, shopping, retail. Very low spending. Okay, So mainly, I guess it was T.J. maxx. Didn't realize that, but how much was the overall? Well, tell me. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:26
You mean your overall spend. 
M
Mariana D
17:28
Yeah, I should probably hold. That way I don't have to go back and open it. Oh, 504. Not awful. Not bad. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:51
So it seems like most of it was. 
M
Mariana D
17:55
Shopping. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:57
Was anything surprising when you looked at this or just looked pretty, like what you expected? 
M
Mariana D
18:02
No, it wasn't, like, that bad. I think this month, since it was, like, the holidays and, like, my anniversary is coming up, I know I was buying, like, a little more extra, so everything just made sense. And I go to CVS a lot just because, like, I always am, like, getting so many different medications. So the CVS one also made a lot of sense because I'm always there. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:21
Yeah, CVS spend. I mean, that's usually more for, like, essential spends, right? 
M
Mariana D
18:28
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:30
Got it, got it. And when you. I guess, like, here, like, for T.J. maxx, was this, like, stuff that you bought for yourself or was this, like, a gift? 
M
Mariana D
18:39
Well, 1113, that was a Christmas haul. So I started buying, like, Christmas presents super early. So that would make sense because I usually. I was like, what did I do? And I was like, oh, it's because it's, like, in November, because it's, you know, end of October into November. That makes sense. But yeah, that was, like, majority of my Christmas shopping with the section, like, a few people. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:04
But yeah, got it. 
M
Mariana D
19:08
What about, like, let's see. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:11
Tik Tok shop? 
M
Mariana D
19:13
Yeah, that was just, like, probably a treat. I have no idea. I don't remember. I think it was maybe like, a pair of pants or something. I'm assuming would have to go back. Okay. It's probably the same thing. I probably bought pants or something for work. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:30
Okay, gotcha. Do you know if you ended up wearing those pants? 
M
Mariana D
19:33
Oh, most. Most, like, wouldn't. Well, let me see. What was it? If we go in the 14th. Hold on. Shop orders. 14th. 14th. What day is this? No, Hold on, I'm looking. Oh, there. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:15
Take your time. 
M
Mariana D
20:18
Let me see. Now. Let's keep going. Does it say, why do I not have anything for the 14th? That doesn't make sense. Unless that's when it's processed. So if it's what I think it is, it's actually not pants. It was like a home from college review, where you do. They have, like, little gigs on home from college. And I bought something so I could review it, and then they reimburse me. So it actually, if I'm correct, because I can't find anything for that date, it was, like, some magnesium supplement, so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:06
Okay, gotcha. So it wasn't. 
M
Mariana D
21:08
I thought it was, but that was the Other month I was looking at it now was. It was like October, but like, in the beginning of October, so. Oh, I was close. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:20
Yeah. No, it's hard to remember sometimes. 
M
Mariana D
21:23
The. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:23
Let's say the. The stuff that you. What was the thing that you bought beginning of October? Those were a pair of pants. Yeah, got it. And. And did you buy it, like, because you were scrolling and you saw something that you liked or were you looking at it for a while? 
M
Mariana D
21:42
I was looking at it for a while and I, like, didn't have any jeans that fit me and I was like, I mean, they look nice. So I. I bought a pair and I was like, we'll see if I like these. I can always get another one after. I didn't want to get to and be like, I don't like them, but I like them. So was happy. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:00
Got it. So you're still wearing them after you bought them? 
M
Mariana D
22:02
Yeah. Yeah. Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:08
And what do you. 
M
Mariana D
22:10
Let's see. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:12
You have, like, two things at Amazon Marketplace. Oh, it looks like it's on the same day. Interesting. 
M
Mariana D
22:17
Do you remember what those are for? Let me see. Amazon, I know, is, like, easy to see. Let's look. So. So I ordered acne patches, like hero patches. And then I must have bought the big box, I'm assuming. And then the other one. Where is the other one? Oh, the other one is a Christmas gift. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:02
Okay. 
M
Mariana D
23:07
But hero patches, I probably. That. I know. I was like, oh, I need more. I'm running low. That was like a. Oh, I need this purchase. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:14
Okay, got it. So that's like a. I guess a staple in some way. It's like, yeah, okay. And then what is what not? 
M
Mariana D
23:25
I don't know what not is. Like, it's like, it's kind of. Well, if I can't explain that. Because if you don't know what Poshmark is, then you won't understand. But it's basically like. It's like a live. They also have, like, people where you can buy from, but it's basically like a live auctioning. Like, and it's. I used to have it, like, before it went viral. And then it went viral and I was like, holy crap. Like, this is crazy. But there's a brand on TikTok, which is like the Pant way. The. What you call it the company where I. I like my work pants from, but they sell it, like, wholesale for like 10 times cheaper. So I was like, oh, perfect. I can get like, a new pair of pants. 
M
Mariana D
24:04
Like, because my other one was like, I. I just needed Another color, something. I forgot what the reason was, or I just wanted one, whatever, so I got a pair or two off of whatnot. Because even, like. Even though, like, some of the auctions can be, like, you know, crazy, and, like, the bids can go up so high, like, there's certain shows where, like, there's, like, a common understanding, like, it won't go past a certain price. So if you buy one or two pairs, like, they're usually the same price because people are not going crazy because everyone wants to get a good deal. So I think if I'm mistaken, that's probably pants again. Oh, good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:38
Gotcha. And so both times you bought these pants, like, I guess your. Oh, I'm thinking about the October one now, and this one were like, I guess. Were those neats. Were those, like, I guess, pants that you were looking to kind of balance out or get more of, to kind of diversify what you have in your wardrobe? 
M
Mariana D
25:00
Yeah, because I, like. I feel like I was wearing, like, the same, like, two to three type of pants for work, and I was like, I don't like this because I just, like, feel like I'm repeating outfits too much. So did I have to do it? Probably not. But I was like, what's another one or two gonna. It was cheap. It's not. It wasn't that expensive. I was like, it's fine. You know, it was not like 50 for a pair of pants. It was not that bad. Yeah. And the other one wasn't really a need. It was just. I. Well, I guess. Yeah. Because I did. My jeans didn't fit, but I was like, did I need jeans? Like, I could have just worn leggings. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:33
Yeah. 
M
Mariana D
25:34
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:34
But I mean, you know, it's okay to, like, spend on yourself. Want something? 
M
Mariana D
25:41
Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:45
I just. I actually just remembered I looked up whatnot before. It's. Yeah. It's like, live commerce. 
M
Mariana D
25:52
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:52
Pretty cool, actually. Do I. Yeah. Just out of curiosity. Seems like. Well, I guess not for everything, but it seems like for TJ Maxx, you got gifts for other people is a big one. Like, I guess shopping for clothes, it's interesting because it seems like most of it has been coming from online. 
M
Mariana D
26:18
Yeah. I really don't go in person, like, that much because, like, nine times out of 10, they usually don't have, like, my size. Even though it's like, you would think they would have, like, a medium in the store, but, like, they really don't sometimes. So it's like, I'll get off online. It's just. It's easier or just like, I don't like the certain brands. I want this brand instead. So. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:39
So basically you want like more choice and also like sizes that you can try. Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess, like, you must be pretty good at, like, I guess, sizing and making sure it fits. 
M
Mariana D
26:52
Yeah, I have a tape measure and everything. Like, I. And if it doesn't fit, I'll have to return it. It's not the end. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:58
Gotcha. So you're like, I feel pretty, like, comfortable. Yeah, yeah, Got it, got it. 
M
Mariana D
27:06
Makes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:08
Makes sense. I guess typically when you do shop at Amazon, like, looking at it, like, would you say most of those are like, needs type of stuff or do you ever do, like, fun shopping on Amazon? 
M
Mariana D
27:25
I feel like it depends because Amazon, it can be like, it's better to get on Amazon than going to person or it's better to get it on Amazon than in person. Like, it depends. Like, if it's like, I need a new makeup thing, oh, but I have a coupon, so I'll go to Ulta. But if it's like, oh, I want this makeup thing, but they don't have it anywhere else, I'll get it on Amazon. You know what I mean? It really just depends on. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:48
Okay, got it. So, like, it depends on, I guess, deals and availability then. Yeah, okay, got it. Actually, the Ulta example is like a good one. Do you remember, like, maybe a time that you went to Ulta instead because it was a good deal? 
M
Mariana D
28:07
Hold on, let me see. Probably. Let me look at my do. Let's go to purchases. Because I remember it happened once I saw it on Amazon and it was like cheaper on Al. So I was like, actually, Yeah. So looking at it now, there was this cream that my grandma wanted for a while and there was like, I guess there was a 20. I had a 20 off purchase and a buy one, get one. So I bought the cream she wanted and I got obviously the coupon and I guess whatever the other one that it was, I don't really remember. It says out of stock. But I got her two creams and it was cheaper versus Amazon because it was like twice more. I was like, oh, so that was an example of that. 
M
Mariana D
28:59
And that was actually last year, like, not last year, like 20, 24. Yeah. So it really just depends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:10
Got it. Got it. For a lot of these things that you're like, I guess, shopping for, well, let's say makeup. Right. Since we're on that topic, like, do you usually, like, I have a thing in mind that you plan for that you want to buy for a while before you get it. 
M
Mariana D
29:29
I guess it depends if, like, I want to say everyday items. Like, it's like I'm running low and I don't have any more. Like, it's like I don't think about twice about like getting it. It's like, oh, I need it. Well, not need it, but like, I'm running low. I should get another one. Like mascara or like something for my eyebrows, like an eyebrow pencil or something. But if it's like something I've never tried or something, it's like maybe a makeup palette. I were like, do I need it? And I might think on it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:59
Okay, Got it. So basically there's some things that you just use to, like, maintain. 
M
Mariana D
30:07
Right? 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:07
Like, okay, these are the things that like, I need. And then like, go get. Go get it. Without, like thinking too much about it. But then for other things, you're like, okay, let me just see if I want to get this after thinking about. 
M
Mariana D
30:20
It for a while. Yeah, basically. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:22
Got it, got it. 
M
Mariana D
30:28
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:29
I think that might be it. I. I do find it. I did want to ask, like, it seems like you have just one dining out expense. Like, do you usually not go out to eat too much? 
M
Mariana D
30:42
Usually? No, like, and like, going out to eat is like, usually like on the weekend. Like, maybe like when my boyfriend and I, like, oh, let's try to do something. Like, let's do something different. Let's go out to eat versus eating at home or something. Like, they will be an example of that. So I guess that day were like, oh, I don't want to eat. Let's go to the buffet and call it a day. Because I really don't want to cook today. Right. So either, you know, he'll cook, I'll cook. Maybe a family member will visit and be like, oh, here, I made you something. But. Or, you know, partnership. Either he'll pay and I'll pay. So this was. I decided to pay this day. Maybe he paid another day. So it really just depends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:18
Yeah, yeah, got it. Yeah. I was wondering actually if you're open to it. Like, do you have another month? Maybe like October? 
M
Mariana D
31:31
Yeah. Hold on. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:32
Yeah, because I'm wondering, like, what a non holiday period. 
M
Mariana D
31:36
Yeah. Because it's kind of holiday. Yeah, I get it. Hold on, let me see. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:05
Grill like one of those like where you have like that big table like those Japanese restaurants, and they're like cooking it on the table. Is that what it is? 
M
Mariana D
32:14
Surprisingly, like, no. Like, oh, they have like a hibachi side, but it's mainly like, just like a crazy buffet. So they have like. Oh, they have some. That one is crazy, though. They have like. I'm trying to think, like, depending on when you go, like, sometimes like. And the thing isn't, like, expensive. It's like 13 a person. Well, okay. It will be cheaper in lunchtime, but you usually go for dinner. Yeah, but, like, they'll give you, like, there's like. Sometimes there'll be like, lobsters or, like crabs that you can get for like a buffet price. And it's crazy because it's like if you go to the restaurant, like a freaking lobster. Oh, my God, forget it. It'll be like a hundred plus dollars. Yeah, well, that's right. They have like, their different. They don't have lobster too much. 
M
Mariana D
33:00
I feel like it's like a special thing. But it's mainly like crab. And they have like. Obviously they have like the fish, like, whatever. Salmon. And I can't think of the other fish. And they'll have like, you know, the general sauce, chicken or whatever other things they want. And then they'll have a sushi section. They have the hibachi section. It's like a buffet. But it's weird because, like, it's not a hibachi girl. The name is deceiving, but it's just. Okay, so let's just email this. That. Let me just download that. Employee. There we go. Okay, so this one was 600.669.7 dollars. TikTok shop was more this and this. I already looked ahead since I was going through TikTok Shop. This was all like the home through college gig. So it was the ones that you. 
M
Mariana D
35:16
The things you buy and then they reimburse you for whatever. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:19
Okay, got it. 
M
Mariana D
35:20
This, obviously, I'm always at cvs. Tick Tock Shop. Oh, that's a total TJ Maxx. I went again. That probably was an actual personal one that I finally did. And CVS makes sense. Dining. Cumberland Farms. Duh. For gas. Easy pass. The. What is this? I don't know what that is. Rmv. Oh, that was my license to renew it. Coffee. Oh, there we go. This has more. And then they have the 10 insights panda buffet. Oh, that was in Connecticut. I was like, where? All right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:18
Oh, I noticed. I guess there. It makes sense that there's more food spent. Because in November. Were you, like, back home for part of it? No. 
M
Mariana D
36:27
Well, I. I'm not. I. I live here, but yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:30
Oh, okay. 
M
Mariana D
36:31
I don't Live. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:32
No, no, you're good, you're. 
M
Mariana D
36:34
It just. It. It really depends on the month. Yeah, this one, the friendlies one, her birthday. So I took her out and was like, here's your birthday gift. And she was like, oh, thank you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:45
Oh. 
M
Mariana D
36:48
Yeah, she loves like friendlies. And I was like, this is like so like New England. Like no one goes there and I don't like eating there. But you know what, you want to eat there, so it's okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:56
So I'll go do it with you. Yeah. 
M
Mariana D
37:03
See. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:06
Was this tick tock shop, the 42 one. That one was. Was that for personal or that was also home from college? 
M
Mariana D
37:11
That was. That was home from college. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:13
Okay, got it. So, okay, makes sense for like TJ Maxx. This one on October 4th. Do you remember what this one was for? 
M
Mariana D
37:22
I think that was probably maybe personal because what did I buy though? I wish that you had the receipt for that. I don't remember like the fourth. I don't think it was like any special occasion. So I probably maybe was like, oh, I want to buy a few things. And I have no idea. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:51
But like nothing like stands out to you around what that was exactly. 
M
Mariana D
37:58
The fourth. Sometimes I can check my email. Let me see if I got like a confirmation receipt from TJ Maxx. Because sometimes they do that. I don't think so. No, I don't. I can't find anything. I don't know. Probably was just like, oh, maybe a few shirts and stuff. I don't think I really remember. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:29
Okay, got it. 
M
Mariana D
38:31
It might have been the day that I went out with my mother in law and got a few things together, I think. But I don't remember if that was October or November. Must have been October then. I. If it says October. But yeah, I'm trying to find if. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:48
It was a weekend or not. October 4th was a weekend, so that jogs. First Saturday of October. 
M
Mariana D
38:57
I'm thinking because I thought I went to Burlington that weekend. So. Was there something that stood out there that I was like, Damn, I don't remember. This is bad. I mean again, it was my mom's birthday that month, so did I get insert something there? Maybe, but I really doubt it because I. I took her out to eat and that was that. I think I just probably got stuff for myself. I honestly do not remember what I bought. I'm just being honest. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:33
Yeah, no, it's totally fine. 
M
Mariana D
39:34
It's. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:35
It's really normal. Got it. So I guess that would be like something that you didn't expect or don't remember from this, probably. 
M
Mariana D
39:46
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:47
Got it. Let's see. Actually, I'm wondering, could you. In the ask anything, right? Can you show me all the shopping transactions organized by. By. Maybe organized by eight. 
M
Mariana D
40:19
Oh, I'm spelling so awful today. My goodness. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:23
The LLM will. Actually, they'll. 
M
Mariana D
40:28
They don't. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:28
They don't care about typos. 
M
Mariana D
40:32
But eight is good by date. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:34
Not eight. 
M
Mariana D
40:34
Oh, date. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:35
Sorry. No, no, it's okay. 
M
Mariana D
40:42
Yeah, so we have. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:44
So here you can see it, like, by date, which can help you maybe remember. Okay, so you have, like, Ulta. 
M
Mariana D
40:56
These. I remembered I needed a shoe stand because. Well, they have a shoe stand on there, and I need to add, like, more tiers to it, so I bought the extra tiers. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:07
Oh, like, the shoe stand has, like, different levels. 
M
Mariana D
41:09
Yeah, it has, like, different levels. And, like, I bought it from there before, but, like, I wanted to expand it, so I just needed to buy the other things. Yeah, obviously, this. If I go back to home from college, it might be a gig. Not 100. Sure. I know. October and September, there was, like, so many Amazon and TikTok shops. Like, I was like, what the hell? Like, it was crazy. Cvs, obviously. Medications, TJ Maxx. I don't remember Ulta. What was that? 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:43
This was the same day, by the way, in case that helps. So, like, I don't know what I was. 
M
Mariana D
41:52
Hold on. Well, let's go to Ulta. What did I buy. October? Why would you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:02
Would you get staples from Ulta? Or like, that would be more like, hey, I'm trying something new. 
M
Mariana D
42:08
Oh, so from Ulta. Oh, okay. There was a student thing that they were doing that weekend, so I got another, like I said, brow pencil. I bought that. And then because I was probably running low, I got a lip balm. Most likely, I. This one I think I wanted to try out. This was, like, a new thing that I saw, like, on Tick Tock, and I wanted to try it. And the other thing I got was free, so it really didn't matter, but yeah. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:38
Oh, so you saw something, like, interesting on Tick Tock, and then you saw it at Ulta, and you're like, I'm gonna give it a try. 
M
Mariana D
42:43
Yeah. And plus, I was like, I needed, like, I, like, I, like the whatchamacallit. The, like, the lip balms that have, like, a tint, but it's like, it gives, like, not gives, like, lip gloss, but, like, it kind of is like a lip gloss, but it's not because it's like, a balm. So I was like, oh, okay, I'll try. I'll see if I like it. And I ended up liking it. So it was good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:04
Okay, gotcha. 
M
Mariana D
43:07
I, I have not the TJ Maxx thing. It might bother me now because I have no idea what I I because I remember what day it was and I remember I was. There's like a strip of store. So I was going in all the stores. I don't remember what I bought. Eventually it'll come to me. Probably like after this call I'll be like, oh, this was the weekend I went to the casino and there was pants on sale. Bath and Body Works. Probably a new scent. American Eagle. Same thing. Outlet store. I think I bought shorts like I said because I was going to Florida, right? Yeah, yeah. But it's like the outlet store, it's like the super cheap outlets that are like very like. It's like crazy. Like you walk in, it's like five dollar shorts. I'm like American evil. Five dollar shorts. 
M
Mariana D
44:00
Hello. Okay. Okay, let me pick out a few things. I forgot how much. Oh, $10. I spent $10. I probably bought two shorts. Tik Tok Shop. Tick. Those were the things. Yeah. That probably I buy. Let's look. Orders. October 19th. Nineteenth. Oh my God. So I did buy my mom something. I thought I just took her out to eat. I bought her a wallet. That's what poshmark was. What the hell? How do I not remember these things? Okay, CVS was probably make medications or something. And then Tik Tok shop. I'm assuming. Let's just look. It's probably just reviewing stuff, but let's check. Yeah. So in October I bought like I guess the pants and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 different things for home through college. From college reviews. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:41
So where the. So the TikTok shop are all home from college. 
M
Mariana D
45:46
Yeah. With the exception of whichever one is there is pants. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:51
Which one's pants? 
M
Mariana D
45:52
October, I think it's this one. This one. Some of that. It was like, it was like multiple items within it. So I'm saying five but it shows up as three because it's probably the same, you know, so it's like 2, 2, 1, whatever it is. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:11
Oh, okay, got it. And then. 
M
Mariana D
46:15
Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:16
No, no, go ahead. 
M
Mariana D
46:17
No, I was just going to say the way ever they split it up and that was just a review for from college. I see. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:24
And then how about for Amazon AM. 
M
Mariana D
46:29
Okay, hold up. Let's see. So 25th. Oh, hold on. Let's filter. 2025. Here we go. Pimple patches one of them, and the other one was the curl cream. I don't know why I put two different times. I probably remembered I need to get something else. But one was the hero patches and the other one was the curl cream that I use the. Sorry. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:18
The curl. Oh, curl cream for like. Yeah, okay. Gotcha, gotcha. So actually, I think you're. You're shopping spend on minus the home from college stuff is actually closer to probably 300 than it is. Like, probably. 
M
Mariana D
47:37
Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:38
Got it. Was there anything what. What stood out to you or, like, surprised you when you were looking through this? 
M
Mariana D
47:46
T.J. maxx. I don't know what I bought. Like, I'm gonna. Like, I'm gonna have to go through my receipts. Be like, what. When. What did I buy? Maybe I bought like, a shirt or something or a hoodie because I cannot remember for life for me. But like, everything else, like, I remembered, like, I have a pretty good memory. It was like, CVS is like I'm always there for medication or like, whatever feminine hygiene products. But, like, it's. Everything else made sense. It's like, oh, went to the casino this weekend, so I went shopping here. This was review. Review jeans. This was mom's birthday present that I thought I just took her out to eat, but I guess I didn't. I. I did other stuff. Yeah. And then obviously patches, curl cream, I guess. Need. Question mark? Yeah. Ulta. 
M
Mariana D
48:37
I think Ulta and TJ Maxx were probably fun trips for that month. And I usually don't do it too much. And I guess she. Because the shoe rack and obviously that too. Yeah, Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:48
So, like, I guess. For which. I guess which of these would you consider was like, the fun spend versus, like. Oh, I spent this because I. It was like a staple or I need to repl. Replenish something. 
M
Mariana D
49:00
Replenish probably Ulta, because one of them was an item that. Because, you know, it doesn't break down, like, everything like Ulta does. At least I was trying the lip thing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:11
There are probably a few things there. Yeah. 
M
Mariana D
49:13
Yeah. But it was. I ran my brow pencil was like, the. I need to replenish this. I guess the. I would say the fun was probably like this. This was probably, like, obviously fun because I cannot remember what I bought. Ulta. Need. And I think this. This. Because this is the weekend that I went to the casino. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:41
Okay. Like, oh, the. I guess the Express, American Eagle, and. 
M
Mariana D
49:48
There'S like an outlet, like, stores and like, just go for like, that near Me are like, kind of like, not that good. So I usually go for their. Just as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:00
Oh, okay. Gotcha. Do you go to the casino with, like, I guess family, friends or, like, by yourself? 
M
Mariana D
50:10
No, I usually go with like, maybe friends or like, maybe my boyfriend, but I usually don't go by myself. It's like. Like it's not in Mass. It's like in Connecticut, so it's like I don't like an hour and a half by myself, like in the middle of a state that I barely know. Like, I don't feel like that. Like, it's just. No, I don't. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:31
So. So, I mean, this seems like it's just. Yeah, it's like. It's like fun, fun. Like a fun span. 
M
Mariana D
50:37
Like you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:38
You make a trip like a. I think it's probably a weekend. It seems like. Yeah, I think 11th is a weekend because October 4th was a Saturday. So, like, it's just like a weekend trip. 
M
Mariana D
50:47
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:48
Or like a weekend like day trip, I guess. 
M
Mariana D
50:50
Yeah. I mean, it's. An hour and a half is like, nothing. It's like, pretty close. Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:56
I forgot how close everything is in the east coast because, I mean, I feel like. 
M
Mariana D
51:01
I don't know the east coast. Like. Like bottom of East Coast. Like, Florida is like, humongous. It's like you cannot. You get to the next town in an hour and a half. Like, it's just like. I feel like it's just like New England. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:13
New England is. Yeah, you're right. Like, I guess I'm generalizing. New England is like, it. It always baffles me that, like, Jersey is so close to New York. 
M
Mariana D
51:22
Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:24
Because, like, that's like going to Sacramento from, like, San Francisco or actually it's even closer, I think, in New England. 
M
Mariana D
51:34
But that's what I was like, saying. It's like. It's just like. I feel like we're spoiled here. It's like we're very close to everything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:39
Like, that's nice, right? 
M
Mariana D
51:41
Except, like, I guess, like the top, like, of like, where, like, I guess mean is like, that's like three to four hours. It's like far, but it's like 10, 20 minutes away from where I am. At least I have New Hampshire. Like, we're just. We're just very, very small. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:06
Let me see. I guess other questions. So was there anything when you were looking at, I guess, this list where you felt like, would you ask this way? Like, when you, I guess, have like a fun budget or like, fun Money to spend each month. You have, like, a idea of, like, what it is in mind each month, or you, like, I guess, look at it afterwards or. Yeah, I kind of look. 
M
Mariana D
52:43
Like. Usually I. Well, I'm like, crazy. So I have, like, an Excel spreadsheet of, like, every single thing that has my name on it and, like, my amount that I can spend within the month or that I have and I can know where I have, like, flexibility. So it's like, oh, I'm going to get paid this week. I know I have bills for this, and this. So I have an extra leave. You wanted to. I could. And also spend. So, like, that. I guess it kind of depends because I don't just, like, spend, like, $300, like, in, like, Zara. Like, I don't really do that. Like, it just kind of. I think it's, like, smaller, like, and it just. I'll usually look at, like, oh, is here. This paycheck? Is all of my bills are paid. Do I have room? 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:36
Hey, Mariana, I think you're. The Internet's, like, kind of choppy. 
M
Mariana D
53:43
Oh, sorry. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:45
No, no, don't apologize. I think the last thing I heard you say, if I'm not wrong, is that, you usually will just, like, look at, like, your paycheck coming in, pay off your, like, main bills, and then you see, like, what's left, and then you just, like, make sure you have basically have enough to cover for the bills and the rest you can just spend it. 
M
Mariana D
54:05
I should be. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:07
Okay, Gotcha. And see what else. I have another app to show, but. 
M
Mariana D
54:30
I don't know if we're going to. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:30
Have enough time to go through it because we just have five minutes left. But I can probably just show you. Thank you so much for going through all of this. It's, like, really helpful. Yeah. So I know you already have, like, a budgeting process on spreadsheets, so what we've been like, designing here is actually a more conversational way to, like, think about and reflect on the spend. Like, kind of like what were already doing, but were using, like, an AI or using ChatGPT out of the box. But how this would work is imagine this is like TJ Maxx. So it could be like, oh, I bought it for somebody else. Let's say this was a gift. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:15
You click this and then what the app will remember is, like, your answers so that you're like, you know, because it's so hard to remember why we spend money on things if it's just transactions. So it helps kind of create like a system to like refer back to. So let's say this one was for, I don't know, like family for like Christmas. So you kind of like label this, but let's say you spent at like, I don't know, let's say for that this is American Eagle. You're like, saw it in the moment. Okay. Treating myself and like, okay, I was on a. I was at the casino over the weekend and wanted to go shopping. And then like, was it. Yeah, that trip. I mean, basically you just chat with it to like share, let's say. Yes, I am. 
M
Mariana D
56:15
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:16
So anyways, it will like kind of go through like reflections. Now obviously not everything is this not meant to be like, oh, this is like a good span or a bad spin or like all that. Like our philosophy with the product is like, it's more just like labeling it and like making sure it makes sense to you. Like, it's okay to treat yourself. It's okay. It's a fun spend. It's just like, okay, once you label it, you can see how much you're spending on the fun stuff and how much you're spending on like treating yourself or, you know, self care, things like that. Yeah, I don't think this probably is this big of a problem for. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:50
Or not I would call it a problem, but it was not as big of a spending for you because some people, they don't have as much awareness around like a lot of food spending. So we have this where you can like guess how much you're spending on, let's say food delivery. And then it'll be like, oh, wow, it's actually a lot higher. But anyways, I don't think that's applicable to you. But yeah, this is what were going to go over, but we just didn't have time. But sorry. No, no, don't. Don't apologize at all. But yeah, it's like a. Like we're looking to kind of experiment with different ways to like, help like capture like what you spent on and why you spent on it to like help with like budgeting better, I guess.
