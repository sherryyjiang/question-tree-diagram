S
Sherry Jiang
00:19
It's good. Pretty low key because most people are traveling where I'm at, so we just have like trivia games and like Christmas dinner hosted. Nothing crazy, but it was. Was fun. 
O
Olivia Darling
00:33
Yeah, it sounds fun. It sounds like kind of like just casual enough where it's like, it's enough like you're like having a good time, but it's not like overwhelming. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:42
Yeah, exactly. I think we had like, you know, nine people over, which is. It's not a small crowd, but it's also like, you know, manageable. So it was nice to like. Yeah. Do dinner and just hang out. 
O
Olivia Darling
00:54
Yeah, it's good. Sounds fun. Yeah, mine was really chill. It was just like me, my parents and my sister and her fiance and their dog. Yeah, they all came over and like, that was about it. We had like a dinner but like, it was pretty low key, honestly. So. Yeah.

Awesome. Well, thank you for getting on the second call. So just to give you a sense of what we'll be doing today, we have another app that we built that I remember last time we had one exercise and this one we took some feedback and then created something new. So the same thing where I'm just going to send you a link and then just. I'll spend most of the time just like not really speaking as much as I can, but just like hearing you go through stuff, voice your thoughts. You did a great job. Yes. That last time. So I think whoever you were doing, just do it again. I may jump in with some questions here and there, but just like, yeah, pretend I'm not here and just like you're using it like on your own. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:04
So for this one I want to check do you have a bank statement or something ready that you can use for it if not or you're not comfortable. We also have like fake data that you can use, but the only thing with fake data is that it's not your data. So. 
O
Olivia Darling
02:19

O
Olivia Darling
04:06
Yeah, I know. I get it. It's my parents house too, and it's weird that we have so many cats here and I'm like, that's kind of weird, but it's. It's kind of like fun. It's like, oh, there's so many of them. You. Okay? Should I. Should this. The. The what you send me? Should that be a link or should I just like copy and paste that into like a. Like a Google?

O
Olivia Darling
08:35
Yeah. I was like, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:37
You're like, I talking about something else. But yeah, just. Oh, you have to. You have to click on the bubble.

S
Sherry Jiang
08:51

Okay, I see. I see. Yes. Yes, it is. So true. So true. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:47
And this doesn't work now, but basically, after you fill that, you would actually get a magnet. So be like. And then it'll say, like, spent with mom, because I like. Yeah, it doesn't work here. So that's why I have to explain it. But that's what it. It's supposed to do. 
O
Olivia Darling
10:05
Okay, that's cute. That's fun. Okay, let's. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. Magnet. So many goes. We learn. That's fun. I like that. That's cute. Go to merchants. That's fun. I can see where I'm spending it.

S
Sherry Jiang
11:01
Actually. Yeah, it popped here. 
O
Olivia Darling
11:04
Yeah, that's fun. I like that. If it's. It feels very like. Like rewarded. Like, oh, I did something good and it, like, rewards me to show me I did it like that. Okay. The staples. Yep. Makes sense. Okay. Cute, cute. Scrap my memories. 791. I don't remember what I bought, so I'm just gonna look what I bought. That way I can be like, yes, I remember if it was an impulse buyer if I needed. Amazon $7. Oh, I remember what I bought. Yes. I. I had to. I bought a product so I could review. Was energy. And did that explain how did that feel for you? It was all right. It was satisfying to do that. Yes, absolutely. Welcome sharing. Okay. O. So I wonder if that did anything. Ooh, two green flags. Thought it would. 
O
Olivia Darling
14:08
You bought a proctored review at her company and found it. Yeah, I did. It was a good time. That's cute. Okay. It's fun. I like that. Oh, can you tell? Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I can just ch. What's on my. Hey, what's on your mind about spending? What is on my mind about spending? Let's do how. How easy would it be to. Track money going in and out every. The list you already have? What would look like. How would it look to see money coming? Tracking chemistry for just logging each spend in the commission you go. What would you like to see most when you're looking monthly flow. Oh, okay. What would you like to see when you look at your monthly flow? I would like to see. When you're coming in more and more going out. Yes. 
O
Olivia Darling
16:11
Oh, what's the Biggest feeling that comes when you think about that gap. Interesting question. Biggest feeling I have is about security. Yes. Bills. Does covering them give you sense of relief or more pressure? Both. What change in your spending could tip it more towards spending less or in a more. Way? Maybe those small. Yes. I really enjoy these questions that they're asking. Just. Cool picture. What's one easy cue you could to notice each purse's purchase as it happens? That's a good question. Maybe. Marking it or maybe marking it. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Desire for more money. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:24
Yeah. 
O
Olivia Darling
18:29
That's. Yes. So true. Okay. That's fun. That was fun. I liked that. Oh, oh. I like that. I think that it took what I said and gave me this like almost like summarized version of it and now I can like go to different parts of that. Like set a goal, track spending, exploring budget. I like that. Is it a goal? Maybe. Yeah. What would hitting that spending goal feel like? Free. Oh, sounds like. Yes. Okay. It would feel like relief. Honestly, if I hit a spending goal, What part of your life would get lighter? I'd say any parts of my life would now that I don't have. Like I wouldn't be thinking about it. I just feel more relief. So many parts. Question. What's the thirsting you'd notice changing? Maybe my mood. Yes, absolutely. Maybe just like extra. 
O
Olivia Darling
20:33
Extra expenses that I don't really need. Like fast food. Oops. Food. Little treats up like the gas station. Yeah. Yes. Not really. But just being more mindful. I really like these questions because it really makes you think about this stuff and I don't know, I just enjoy the way it prompts me. How would. How would I remind myself maybe. Taking a moment to just think if I really. Oops. I really need it or just want. Yes, absolutely. Hey. Yes. Think that. Wait, How do you keep track of those weeks in a note journal? Just a quick mental check. Maybe. Maybe. Did you meet it papa before you order? Maybe so. Yeah. I like that. Do you mean it yet? Yes. Agree. Thank you. Thank you. Now I set a spending goal. Yeah. Okay. It was fun. I liked it. Okay. This week. Okay. 
O
Olivia Darling
23:44
Enjoyed that. That was fun. Maybe I should do another one. Just. My mind about spending. Figuring out. How to. How to set. What part of your life would you like money to show more clearly. Figuring out how. Figure out how to put money into saving out is putting too much how to put money into saving account. Let's check. Okay. You picture that many saved. What does it feel like you're building for yourself? A secure future. Okay. What would a secure future look like day to day for you. Like not. Not having to worry about honey every day or wondering if I'll have enough. Okay. I would feel less. Okay. Okay again. I still really like how it's prompting me with each and how it like wants me to talk about how I feel. 
O
Olivia Darling
26:32
I really like that because like you're really making me think about my purchases and how like my feelings around spending. Which of your recent purchases feel most like they're tied to that guilt. What do those coffee or take out moments give you that make them worth it? Despite the guilt? I think that it's awesome it. And I think sometimes I can justify it by saying I deserve it. Treat. Sounds like desire at moment is rewarding. So maybe a little self care treat. What feeling are you hoping to honor when you give yourself that reward? That's a good question. Maybe a little self care treat. What feeling are you hoping to honor when you give yourself that reward? Must like a self care. I feeling like a self care feeling or like achieving worthiness. Oh okay. 
O
Olivia Darling
28:19
What if you like bath would feel safe active self care for your future. I feel like it would feel safe and smart. Yes. Okay. Perfect. Talked about how you want to secure. Yeah. Yes. Go safer. It is. It sure is. I wonder if it's. Oh, I wonder if this changes anything in like my scrapbooks. Oh my gosh. It does. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Setting spending goals, balancing and seeking spending awareness. Sharing treats, reviewing products. Okay. I like that. That's fun. It gives me like. Okay, okay. I'm surprised I don't have any of those. And I'll have green flags so that's awesome. I wonder what a red flag would be though. Interesting. Okay. Oh okay. Oh okay. Let's explore budgeting methods. Budgeting fun budget. Right. How do you do people? I haven't really. Dramatic. 
O
Olivia Darling
30:34
What would a budgeting approach need to feel like a supportive part of your what would a budgeting approach need to be like up? It would need to feel like it was easy to follow and yeah basically it's just like it was easy to follow. That makes sense. Any steps or tools feel simple enough that you can stick with them without feeling like a chore? Maybe just like straight forward. Straightforward. Like straightforward writing showing money in and out and places where it going. Sling that on paper or a single sheet. Feel like you could give you a guess. Yes. First category, maybe monthly. Oh my gosh. So you start with the unnecessary evil side. Car insurance. Yes. It's laid out and it makes it feel. Sounds like you're giving yourself your boost by making everything visible. 
O
Olivia Darling
33:05
What's the next thing you'd add to keep to the picture complete? Maybe like gas tracking adjustment each week. How you swap patterns or feel more ease with the totals? Maybe because. Then I become more aware. It's like a self care habit. A quick template. Yes, it would. Okay. Just add a row each time money moves. Feel free to try filling in today's numbers. Okay, so. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Whoa. Okay. I don't think I can. Yeah, right. Yes, sorry. Right. That makes sense. I like this thing that it created for me. It feels very easy to use and like something I could easily go with. Okay, let me get to these numbers. Yes, I could. Will you help me? Yeah. See Good. And this pay period. Oh, like not sure. What should you see on your check before taxes? Got it. 
O
Olivia Darling
35:06
That's your monthly contract payment. And roughly how much do you spend on gas each month? Okay. It's hard to say. I don't have a job right now, so I'm not making anything. So it's zero dollars. My car insurance is. I think it's one. It's 178. How much do I spend a month on gas? I've not been driving that much, so I probably spent like honestly probably maybe $50 on G. Or. I think I need. I'm just gonna say no for. You. Put it like that. Not good. Not good. Trying to have like a $10 car or 10. Well, I got a job so I will be making money. Thank you. What's the take on p.a. You anticipate. It'll be. I don't really know yet. Maybe like I get every two weeks. So every two weeks around. I don't know. Maybe like I'll do $500. 
O
Olivia Darling
37:31
That seems like enough. $500. And I'm not sure how much. $50. Be checked. $100 a month. Maybe some are building up. What if I did? Oh yeah. Starting smaller. I like the options that it gave me or it gave me options where to like help me starting smaller. Yeah. Yes it does. And yes it does. Okay. Adding 22 savings is paying. They're like already used or is anything else you'd like to do now? Feels. Yeah. No. Yeah, that was helpful. That felt. That felt easy to do. Like navigate as well. Like we're like doing that. I didn't feel confused really. I felt very straightforward and. And I like that it worked with me. Each time I would say something new. 
O
Olivia Darling
39:27
Like the fact that I said, oh, I don't like I got a Job and it's like, okay, how much are you going to be getting each month or like how much do you anticipate you're going to be getting? And I didn't. It told me each month or like take home pay and I told it weeks and it worked with my weeks like every two weeks. And so it didn't like it worked with what I had. I liked that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Explore budgeting methods. Yes. I set a spending goal. Okay. Okay. What else should I talk about with you? What else do I need to know? What's your spending? If I'm okay, I'm making $2,000 equity every month and spending 228. I think that's right. On bills. What. Should I be. Good amount to set aside? Okay. 
O
Olivia Darling
41:35
Right now your tree spending is about $24 a month. Okay. So I like that it used the knowledge it had about me, which is roughly 2 to 3% of it. I think that's okay. Does it seem on this okay? Yeah. 24 is pretty modest. Yeah, I thought so. Feel satisfying or would you like a bit more room to enjoy? No. What if I want so I'm going to like this number. Does it seem men trouble to keep doing Sounds steady. Yes. Is there any upcoming expenses or changes? I don't. I think it'll be easy. But what if I did want it lower. Or okay. More saving. 
O
Olivia Darling
43:27
I really like how it's like when I ask it a question or I say something, it really does go along with what I'm saying and it like really it really tries to learn more about what I want. I like that. Nice. Boosting savings feel like something you'd love to see the actual save my support down the line. I also like that like with this question it wants to know more about me and what's like important to me for my like financial like goals, I guess which I think is helpful. Money saved for future feels when I get my own place. Yes. How does thinking about having your own place feel for you right now? A little scary with my current. Situation. I hear that. Yes. Feel big when things are tight. 
O
Olivia Darling
44:53
What's the part that feels the most unsettling about moving charge sp? Well, not having funds to sustain that. Right. Oh my gosh. That was crazy. That would make sense. Having a cushion can ease the stress. Feels like a comfortable buffer before you take the next step. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:33
It glitched out a little bit, but it's supposed to provide a summary. But you can see that it's sharing its thought process. So this assistant Says, Oh. 
O
Olivia Darling
45:43
I was like, what's happening? Oh, my gosh. Okay. That was so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:50
It's a lot of text, but it's supposed to basically summarize what. 
O
Olivia Darling
45:54
Like, let's talk about. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:55
Yeah, I give like a suggestion. 
O
Olivia Darling
45:58
Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'm just. Yeah. I think. I mean, I mostly understood what was saying, so. Yeah. But yeah, okay, that's fine. I wonder what it will give me from this now. I think. Yes. I wonder if it did anything. Oh, now I have a beige flag. Oh. Oh, yes. So it recognized that I have impulse buys because I talked about that and. Yes. So yes, it is a. That makes sense. Okay. Budgeting, doing products. Yes. Yes, I have. Yes, that's fun. Okay. Cute. Yes. Okay. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay. My treat. Budget. Let's explore this. More. Chips, donuts. Or just pass. A particular mood or moment that makes you reach for those snacks. Okay. Okay. Thought process. After doing. Doing something like. Yeah, just something usually. Good question. That. Yes. Feels like I'm wok. Essentials unwind. Oh, new taste discovered. Snack enthusiast. Cute. 
O
Olivia Darling
48:21
Does that feel essential unwind. It's just like a extra and could be scary. Maybe something I already have or. Not doing it all online and just parts and. What's something that you already have? Maybe like just like, I don't know, Peanut butter and chocolate chips. How does it feel thinking about this? Okay. Makes me feel better. Not bending. That's not much. Yes, it definitely does. Okay. I enjoy that. It's like, it's also like trying to make me think about other things after, like, I talked about this and how this makes me feel, but it's like, okay, like, what else could you do? Okay, it's one tiny habit you'd like to try next. What other habits do you want to try? Maybe using. Yields or maps to get reduced prices. Duncan. Okay. Okay. I. I like that. 
O
Olivia Darling
51:26
Then it prompts me to continue to think about, like what I'm saying. Like, it's like. It's like, would this really help you or do you just think it would? Like, it's really making me think about my decision, I guess. And I think that's helpful. Planned perk. Okay. Keep the two pen. Yeah. The one item. That's a good. I like. I like that. That was kind of a helpful move when I said, I don't know, maybe it's. Maybe I would be tempted. Then it continued to prompt me into a way to almost like help me think about it differently. And so then I maybe wouldn't be as tempted and stuff like that. I liked that. Like Prompt. I guess this prompt of it. Sounds solid. How would you remind yourself of the one item when you open? Note that it only is one item. Now. 
O
Olivia Darling
53:39
Yes. Yeah. I really enjoy how it really works through you with it all. Like, with every step of the way. It was very much there with me and what I was doing. It was, like, continuously, like, going through it. Like, when I mentioned the Dunkin app, it, like, prompted me with that. And then, like, when I prompted it with, like, oh, maybe it would tempt me. It went with, like, okay, if it does tempt you, what can you do to curb that? So I really liked how it goes through with me with every step of the way I'm doing. Oh, your people, mother. Oh, no. Beige pots purchasing gas station treats. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. And then saving for your future housing. Yeah. Yes, yes. Okay. That was good. 
O
Olivia Darling
54:54
I wonder if you wonder if a red flag would be just, like, completely unaware. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:03
Hey, Olivia. 
O
Olivia Darling
55:05
Hi. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:06
So we just have three minutes left. You were doing such a great job. I didn't want to, like, interrupt or, like, ask too many questions because I just wanted to listen. But I guess in the remaining three minutes, I would love to just hear your thoughts about your experience going through things so far. Just whatever. Yeah. Comes to mind. 
O
Olivia Darling
55:30
Yeah. I mean, this. Honestly, I really enjoy the way this app or, like, how it goes through you with everything. I really enjoy it because it feels like. Because sometimes I feel like you have to, like, really say a lot for an app or, like, a. Anything to understand what you're trying to get the point across. Like, you really have to explain yourself. And I really enjoyed that you. You really don't have to explain yourself. And it's almost like it will. It, like, understands you very easily in a way. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:01
Yeah. 
O
Olivia Darling
56:01
Where it also. It feels like if I do say something, if it wants more from me, it will ask me specifically what more it wants. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:10
Yeah. 
O
Olivia Darling
56:10
And it's not guessing, like, what. Well, what kind of information do you want? It's very specific, I think, as well. Like, it's. I think it's very specific, and I like that about it a lot. Where it, like, I also enjoy that when it does get my answers or same answers, it goes off based off what I say. And it's not like, there's no, like, jumping to conclusions or jumping to, like, anything random, I guess, because sometimes I think where it's like, it's almost like doing something that's not connected. And it's always going based off my last message or like. Or like. But I Also enjoy that it also had the information. When I mentioned something, it was like, oh, your monthly stuff spending is $24 a month. We're brought in prior information to help me, but it wasn't, like, random. 
O
Olivia Darling
56:57
Like, it was proper information. Yeah. So I like that. I feel like it's pretty straightforward and easy to use as well. Like, I'm not confused about anything in the sense of, like, it's complicated to find stuff. It's pretty straightforward, and I feel like, even if, like, it's like, with these, it would sometimes say, like explore budgeting methods or, like, the different little things here, you always have the option of custom, which I thought was nice, where you can, like, make it your own still. I like, with these, like, the spending, like, needed it or impulse buyer, you can do the custom, which I find pretty helpful because, like, obviously, like, it doesn't know necessarily, and so, like, you can show it. And I feel like it also can learn from that. I don't know. 
O
Olivia Darling
57:53
I think it's pretty easy to use and straightforward, which I like about this. And I really enjoy the conversation because it. It feels like it's really making you think about your spending. And it's not necessarily, like, it doesn't necessarily make you feel bad about the spending either. It's like, it's not shaming you. Like, because I was saying, like, I didn't have a monthly income, and it wasn't shaming me being like, oh, well, why? Well, you shouldn't be spending money then, or you shouldn't be, like, doing these things. It was more like, okay, you. You want to do better, so how do you think you can do that? Like, what do you think you could do to Maybe even make $10 this month? It was never a shameful thing to spend the money or do anything. It was just, like, helpful. So. Yeah. That's all. 
O
Olivia Darling
58:47
Yeah. I mean. I mean, yeah, I really like the app. It's, like, really easy to use, too. Where I'm not. I don't feel intimidated to use it either. Where it's not like, I'm scared of, like, using it's gonna be hard or, like, it's not gonna understand or I'm gonna be confused, because I feel like if I was confused and I asked it to, like, be like, hey, can, like, can you explain this more? Can you do this more with me? I think it would. And I wouldn't feel like, oh, I don't get it still. Mm. So, yeah. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:21
And when you said, like, you're glad that this app, like, was easy to use and didn't confuse you or shame you. Do you have apps that you have used that make you feel that way? 
O
Olivia Darling
59:33
I mean, I've, like, used, like, Nerd Wallet, and it didn't shame me. It just confused me. Okay. Yeah. But other than that, no. I just feel like sometimes with spending apps and, like, money, it can be very almost shameful or, like, feel shameful. And I feel like that's really hard sometimes to, like, combat, like, using one that isn't, like, shameful or, like, too complicated and stuff like that. So. Yeah. Gotcha. Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:00:05
And is there anything that you would improve about the experience so far? 
O
Olivia Darling
01:00:14
Not really. The only thing I can say is, like, maybe making like. Like, sometimes, like, were talking in the app and then it would just kind of, like, stop, which I think is kind of helpful. That way the conversations aren't going on forever. Forever. But I think making the converse, being able to, like, and then that might just be on this system where it only, like, limits a short thing. But other than that, I think it runs pretty smoothly where I'm not, like, it's. It didn't seem really, like, weird or anything.

Gotcha. So I guess in certain cases, you wish that it would find a way to still continue the chat and continue exploring, but I give you the choice.

Right. Like, if you wanted to end it, you're like, okay, I'm done. But it gives you the ability to say that versus okay, that's cool.

Sherry Jiang

Okay.

Olivia Darling
01:01:01
Yeah, I mean, other than that, because I think that sometimes I'd like to maybe explore deeper into things, but it was just like, take care. And I was like, yeah, for sure. Okay.

Got it. Thank you so much, Olivia. That's all the questions I have. So we've concluded two conversations. So we'll make sure the gift cards hard and everything is settled on our side. And you've been awesome. And if we have more stuff coming up in the future for you to test out, we'll reach out. But I just want to thank you so much for your time.

Yeah, thank you, guys. You know, this was fun. I really enjoyed doing this. I'm honestly going to keep using the app because I'm like, it's really helpful. Like, I really like it.

Yeah, we're going to try to. So this one is not on the App Store yet, but we're working on making this first the one on the mobile. I mean, you can use this, obviously, in the browser right now, but we're trying to make it more automatic so you can. You don't have to upload a statement every time you use it, because. I know. But, yeah. Thank you so much.
