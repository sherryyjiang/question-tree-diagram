I'm good. How are you? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:07
I'm good. Did you have a good holiday season? Yeah, it was good, yeah. Do anything, like, special with family or friends or. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
00:22
Yeah, it was my birthday and my friend also had a Christmas party. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:28
Oh, nice. Happy birthday. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
00:32
Is. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:32
Is your birthday on Christmas or it's like around the Christmas time? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
00:36
It's a little bit before. It's on the 19th. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:40
Okay. Happy birthday. I think you're 23 now, right? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
00:45
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:47
Very cool. And by the way, I also have on the call Jaslyn, who's just shadowing the call. She's on our team as well, so. Yeah. Jasmine, this is Yalda. This is the second time we've been chatting with her, giving feedback on what we're working on. Hi. Yoda, Nice to meet you. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
01:06
Hi, nice to meet you as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:10
All right, so thanks for the time that you had last time. How we're going to do it this time is focus on sharing an app, something that we built as the next iteration based on some of the feedback before. What I'm going to do is I'm going to send you a link to use the app. You do have to upload a recent bank statement or something that has some transactions in there to use it just so you can see what some of those insights are going to be. And then same drill as last time were doing the exercise where, just like pretend that we're not here. Just like use it as naturally as possible. And then whenever you have like thoughts that pop into your head, just like pretend you have a microphone to your head and you're voicing it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:59
Strip of consciousness. I'm just going to share with you the link and let me know. Oh yeah, please do share your screen as well. I send it in the chat. Skip the Fireflies one. Just find one called Book Peak Money. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
02:31
So do I just download it on my phone or do I. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:35
It's just a web app, so you should be able to like type it into your URL in your browser. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
03:08
It. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:51
Yeah. So take your time if you need to. Just find a statement. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
03:57
Yeah, I'm just. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
04:01
Pulling up my statement right now. It. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:16
Yeah. These are some intro screens, so feel free to go ahead and click through and then the app should load up and then go ahead and just navigate and use it as you would like. Don't worry about what you think we should have you do. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
05:32
Okay. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
05:46
Okay. Return to this seat twice. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
05:54
Is this becoming a quiet ritual for you? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
06:07
Thanks. So just answer How I would answer usually again. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:19
Yes. Yeah, you couldn't see me, but I'll just. Yeah. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
06:36
What's your favorite breakfast treat? Oh, okay. It. Oh, I guess I have to type that. Magnets, memories, and spots come together into a scrapbook story. This replica is growing. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
07:53
Keep chatting. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
07:54
Every conversation helps peak. Learn what matters to you. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
07:59
You turn to the seat twice. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
08:02
Is this becoming a quiet ritual for you? Just passing? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
08:11
What caught your eye about that spot. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
08:13
When you walked by? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
08:22
Actually, can I change my answer? 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:28
Which part? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
08:31
Like, just passing by. Can I change it to daily ritual? 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:37
Yeah, go. Go ahead. Just, like, type it into the chat. Oh, it disappeared. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
08:46
Okay. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
08:49
Oh, I thought. I thought if I go. Yeah, if I go back, it will. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
08:58
Like, let me change it. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
09:00
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:01
No, it's. I think it logs it the first time. But I guess on that note, did you. What made you, like, pick just passing by initially and then you did eventually change your mind, right? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
09:14
Well, I thought just passing by means, like, you know, you're kind of like, just like, visiting the place. Like, sometimes I didn't think, like, it meant, like, you just. You saw the store and you, like, just. Okay, I don't know, pass by, like, physically. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:34
Got it. So the option choice kind of wasn't clear to you until you started chatting with people? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
09:41
Yeah, like, daily ritual. I would have put that, but I don't visit that place daily. So I was. Maybe it's not as strong. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:52
Okay, so for you, it was more like, it is a ritual. Maybe it's not daily, but it's more regular than like, oh, I was just passing by the place. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
10:01
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:02
Okay, gotcha. Let me see if you can do this. So go back to the app. I'm just gonna try to click compose. See if you can tell it. Hey, I would like to change whatever coffee spot you have to a ritual and maybe say, like you previously answered, just passing by. I want to just see if this works. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
10:58
What does that little moment bring to your day? 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:18
It. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
11:59
Okay, I guess. Okay. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
12:10
Yeah, it kind of changed it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:14
Yeah. That's the first time I've seen it work this way. So I was like, okay, I hope it works. But basically the idea is when you share a bit more detail around, like, what a spend means to you, then this should adjust. And then just remember, like, when we have a magnet or something that represents that spend that we take into account, like what you told us when you were reflecting with the app. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
12:42
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:45
Now feel free to continue. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
12:49
To a new cafe. Did you go with a friend? So feel free it. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
13:53
And do you want Me to go back into last week as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:59
Do, do whatever feels natural. I'll give you a couple minutes just to, like, freely explore, and then I may have you click into some areas, but just like, go where your eye is drawn to. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
14:10
Okay. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
16:27
19. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
19:14
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:21
Yeah. Tell me, how did that chat feel to you? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
19:26
It was good. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
19:28
It kind of made me reflect a bit more. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:35
So one question I have is, what made you click on, I guess, composer to chat with the app in the first place? Was it like you had something specific in mind or you were kind of just curious what it would be able to do? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
19:53
I guess because when I clicked through the week, there wasn't really anything else to interact with, so I thought I. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
20:02
Could chat with it a bit more. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:05
Okay, got it. So basically you were. You felt a little bit of curiosity of where else can I, like, interact with? Yeah. Okay, got it. And when, I guess as you were going through the chat, how did you feel about, like, the tone and the way the app was asking you the questions? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
20:35
It was good. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
20:35
I felt like I wanted the app kind of wanted. Wanted to get to know more about what's going on and how these purchases. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
20:48
Are making me feel? 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:51
Yeah. And did you find that it was clear why the app was asking these questions and how that would be used in the future? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
21:05
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:12
Do you mind giving me an example of, like, where you felt. Oh, okay. Like, I get what this. Why this app is asking me questions and where this information would be used? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
21:34
When it said, like, what. What's one area that I could trim back a bit, I feel like that was pretty valuable information that I could use. And. When it asked, like, Because. Yeah, when I gave an example that I made a purchase on a flashcard app, I feel like when I asked, like, how I felt about it, I feel I also felt like it was. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
22:16
Taking in that information and just keeping track of that. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:25
Got it. And you said that the part where you were asked, like, where you can trim back spending, you said that it felt like this information could be valuable. Could you define what you mean by valuable in this case? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
22:40
Yeah. So since I said just trim back shopping and coffee trips, I felt like that information is valuable because the app can just kind of figure out what I'm not trying to spend on. What's kind of bad spending for me. Yeah, like, quote, unquote, bad spending for me and what I should, like, be. I should be, like, what is, like, good spending for me. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:13
Got it. Got it. So you felt like the app was getting to know what you. I guess Quote, unquote, classify as good and bad so that it can guide you better in the future, taking into account like what it knows about you specifically? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
23:27
Exactly. Like what I feel like would have been unnecessary spending. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:33
Got it. And these, I guess, would not be as obvious from just looking at like a bank statement. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
23:42
Yeah, exactly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:45
Got it. Did you feel like there was anything new or interesting you learned about yourself when you were chatting with the AI? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
23:56
I guess it kind of made me think about it more. It made me think about what exactly. Like what kind of spending I was. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
24:06
Doing that was productive. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
24:09
Yeah, I felt like I wasn't doing anything, but then I was like, oh, never mind. Like, I actually spent money on an app that could help me. I just need to, I just need to use it now and that's it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:27
Oh, you mean the flashcard app. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
24:29
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:34
Do you feel like after seeing that you're like, oh, I'm going to go use this app a bit more? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
24:39
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:42
And in a way, did you find it because it was like align to some kind of value that you had around where you want to be putting more of your money? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
24:51
Yeah, exactly. Because I felt when I bought that app, I felt good about it. The flashcard app, you can use it on your computer for free. For free. But I just don't, I just, I don't know, I just don't like using like a flash, like flashcards on a, on my laptop. So I felt like my phone would have been better. Yeah, I just took the. Took. Yeah. Took the liberty of just spending $25 for the mobile app. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:27
Yeah. Basically, like if it's available on my phone, I'm going to do something that I enjoy or prioritize doing more. It's worth the money to spend and invest here. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
25:39
Exactly. And it's more convenient for me since I just enjoy that format better. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:47
Yeah, makes sense. And now on the question around, like the areas that you said you wanted to trim back on, which was coffee and shopping, what made you pick those two specific spending areas? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
26:04
That's just recently. That's just what I've recently been spending on is just like shopping and. Yeah, especially like very recently, like in the last two days. Okay. I've been shopping too. So those are just the most recent categories. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:26
Okay, gotcha. Makes sense. So it's just like top of like, I guess, easiest to kind of remember. Oh, these are what I've done. Okay, got it. And was there anything within the interaction of the chat, did you find weird at all or did you Feel like it was relatively easy to use and natural. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
27:00
I feel like it was easy to use. I don't think there was anything. Anything weird. I guess I just feel like. I guess I just felt like. I guess I didn't really make too many purchases that, like. I feel like there wasn't really. I guess in my scenario, too many purchases that I could make that would help me with my peace of mind. That's kind of what I felt as I was chatting with it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:10
Okay. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
28:12
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:13
So that wording was maybe a bit off, that maybe the peace of mind is like not making the purchases versus actually making the purchases. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
28:22
Yeah, okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:25
But then other than that, you're like, okay, I get why it's asking me these things, and it seems pretty straightforward. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
28:31
Yeah, it was helpful. It made me think of an example. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
28:35
Of a productive purchase. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:38
Okay, got it. Let's see. So did you feel like it's. It's almost like you had these things sitting in your head, but then the chat was able to ask you questions to bring those things out that you. I sort of knew inside, but then just maybe haven't connected all the dots just quite yet? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
29:10
Yeah, it was kind of like. Kind of like when you see, like a. When you see, like, a therapist, like, you don't know. You don't know, like, too much about what's going on with you until you talk to them and they kind of bring things out of you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:28
Yeah. Have you gone to a therapist before or a coach? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
29:35
I have, but. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
29:37
But. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
29:39
Like, it was a while ago. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:42
Okay, got it. The reason why I was asking is. I was just wondering the. I guess the reference point of, like, therapy and everything. Got it. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
29:54
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:55
Now, going to the section around the weekly reviews, I wanted to try to see how you felt about, like, my first question is how you felt about seeing all these different weeks displayed this way. Like, what was your first impression? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
30:36
The. The flags were kind of. Were kind of surprising to me. It was kind of funny too. Oh, yeah? 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:47
Why? So. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
30:52
I don't know. I just didn't expect it. But it's kind of funny because I guess it's just kind of calling you out in a way, like, if it knew. I guess if it knew, like, my. If it had all my statements, there would have been some stuff in the red. In the red flag section. Yeah, it was just kind of funny to me. I didn't expect to see that. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:29
Go on, go on. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
31:32
And. Yeah, I guess it was kind of nice. Just. Yeah, it was nice to kind of see everything weekly I'm just curious, like, what the things you love go to merchants and people will kind of how that would kind of pop up too. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:19
Yeah. I have one question, and then I can show you something that is not on your side, but I can show some, I guess, designs on it. When you said that you like seeing things weekly, can you share a little bit more about that? Because we're also, like, thinking, is it daily, is it weekly, is it monthly to show these kind of recaps? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
32:46
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:48
Yeah. For yourself. Yeah. What. What's nice about weekly? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
32:57
Weekly is. Weekly is nice, as you could see, I guess. Yeah. You could see just kind of your total spending added up. I feel like maybe if you could change between. If you could change between daily and then like weekly having like two options you could just kind of switch back and forth with, that would be good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:31
Got it. Got it. But not monthly for you, then. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
33:46
Maybe not. I mean, monthly could be. Could kind of give you, like, give you, like, an idea as a whole. But I feel like maybe monthly, I guess, some purchases you might forget about, like just like in the beginning of the month. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:19
Okay, got it. So I guess for you feel like when it's at the weak level, it's easy for you to remember what happened. So it's a little bit more meaningful just based on memory. Okay, got it. I'm going to show you something, so stay on the screen. Before we go back to your app we've created, because you can't see any magnets on your app because you don't have a whole bunch of transactions yet, we designed, we leaned into a metaphor of magnets on a fridge. But basically, as you use Peak, you will collect essentially these magnets. I'm going to refresh because I think I was playing around with it. So I'm going to. I just start new. So this could be. I think you mentioned you like Boba and like, Treats coffee. So you can see, maybe this would be your. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:34
Your book that you bought. I think it was Summer I Turned pretty. I'm trying to remember because I remember I looked it up. This could be like maybe your flashcards. So basically you'll have like a collection of different things that you spend on. And when you click into it, you can see, like, your spending your recent ones at a certain place. And you'll also be able to see your reflections as well. So imagine you were sharing on the flashcard, one that you really value spending money on learning and productivity. So it's something that you value and care about. So that would Also go there. And then in order to add more to your magnets, you would basically review your spending that happened recently. So I'm just going to take coffee as an example because I think that's maybe the more relatable one for you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:31
So maybe you got it with your friend. It's this ritual and makes you feel happy. So then this is the magnet that you would earn to represent the spend at that coffee place you can add to the fridge. And then you see this. Well, I can't really click this here, but yeah, that's. That's a, that's what's supposed to go into your page on the app. But of course that isn't really filled from the start. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
37:14
Yeah, looks. It looks really creative. Like I like the idea of like. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
37:20
Magnets on a fridge. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:23
When you first saw. So there was actually a small pop up. I don't know if you remember in the beginning of using the app where there were some sample questions you answered and then it explained to you, hey, you got this magnet. I don't know if you remember it was the question were you able to make a connection around what that was at that specific step or you weren't able to. You were only able to understand it after like we walked through the fridge just now. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
37:59
Yeah, I had a. I made a connection like that all the magnets that I would get would kind of end up in this section. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:14
Okay. It's just that they didn't appear yet. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
38:17
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:21
Got it. And you said that you like the magnets and it feels creative, like. Yeah. Could you explain maybe a little bit more like. Yeah. What comes to mind when you say that? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
38:36
Just because I feel like it's a good, like you think of. Just because you do add like magnets like on a fridge or like any other papers. So I feel like it's a good concept. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:01
And would you prefer the way that it's visualized to seeing like charts and numbers? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
39:12
Yeah, I feel like it's just like that, that type of design, like you don't really see. So I feel like it's nice. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
39:23
It just looks like. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
39:26
Looks. It looks good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:32
And do you find that the magnets would motivate you to want to like use the app on another day to collect them? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
39:49
I think so. I think what kind of motivates me more that I, I feel like if the app also kind of rewarded you on good behavior too. Like it saw that you made like a credit card payment. I feel like that's kind of really motivating. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:22
Got it. So for you, it's also like, I guess, not only collecting, but, like, collecting the good behaviors and the app being like, good job. Like, you did this. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
40:33
Yeah. Because that's kind of what Debbie does. And then it also, like, sends me a notification. It's kind of, like, just simple, but it makes me happy. Like, it just. It'll just be like, oh, like, I spy. Like, you know, you made, like, a. You made, like, this amount payment towards your credit card. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:01
Yeah. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
41:05
So I feel like not only noticing, like, I feel like the bad stuff is also, like, really important too. Like, it categorizes, like, based on, like, red flags. And I feel like that's really good. Kind of like the app calling you out. But I feel. But I feel like at the same time, the app should also be like, good job, too. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:31
How would you feel like, if the app recognized that you were trying to spend less at coffee, and then the next week you did spend less at coffee, maybe you spent four times, and the next week you spent two times, and the app was like, hey, good job, Yalda. You trim down coffee, spend as you said, so you can spend more on, like, productivity. Good job. Like, would that make you feel. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
41:55
That would be. That would be. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:56
Okay, got it. Got it. Okay, that's. That's super helpful. So it's like, not just like, okay, here's information, but, like, make it meaningful to me around either, like, telling me I'm continuing to do a good job somewhere, or I noticed something that was bad or something I wanted to fix, and I went and actually did it. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
42:15
Mm. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:17
Gotcha. Okay, now I have a few questions, actually, specifically about the coffee ritual part, because I'm just kind of curious. Right. Since you've mentioned it a few times, do you find right now that you are spending the right amount on your coffee ritual? Or, like, do you feel like there's areas where you're like, maybe. Maybe it doesn't have to be as much. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
42:49
I feel like. I guess it just depends. I feel like sometimes I do spend too much, but, Yeah, sometimes I do spend too much, but sometimes I don't. I just don't have time to go, I guess. So I spend less. I said I don't go as often. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:18
I see. So is it pretty? Like, I guess occasional. So it's like, you may notice you're like, oh, I've been three tape. Three days in a row now that I want to. Like, I'm aware of that frequency. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
43:35
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:36
Okay. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
43:36
Just like, with the shopping, like, this past weekend, like, this weekend I've just been shopping a lot and I'm just like, I kind of need to stop. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
43:50
And kind of cut it down a little bit. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:54
Yeah. When it like I guess with the coffee spend, right. Like. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
44:04
What? 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:04
I guess what made you like, I guess what kind of value do you get out of it? Like for you, is it like you enjoy the act of going out to get something like a small treat or is it like I just want the caffeine. 
Y

What's really again, I wouldn't spend as much if I didn't think like it was a. Because I'm trying to do things to make myself study. So I feel like a coffee shop is just kind of a good environment, especially if it's quiet to study and just get a good drink too as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:51
Oh, okay. So for you it's actually like not just okay, I'm getting a treat but it's. It's actually a quiet environment for you to like get to be productive, I guess. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
45:02
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:04
And is it most of the time that you are doing it to study or like it's. It's a mixed bag. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
45:24
I guess. Yeah, I guess most of the time it would be to study. Since I guess, yeah, pretty much most of the time it would be to study. I would get like the drinks casually too, but yeah, I haven't done that in a while. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:53
Yeah, I. I find that really interesting because you know when you were chatting with Peak and the. When you're press compose, you said you wanted to spend money on productivity and then trim coffee and shopping. I'm wondering if. Yeah, basically coffee still is majority considered for you a productivity spend, which means you are spending it in an okay way. Right? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
46:21
Yeah, I was just thinking that too. Like what if it's. What is actually productivity? 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:28
Yeah. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
46:33
Kind of. I feel like if I actually get studying done over there, then yeah, I would consider. Consider it. Like okay, it's going towards my productivity. But if I'm there like I'm trying to do other things on my laptop, then yeah, maybe not. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:52
Got it. That. That makes sense. And let's talk about shopping actually because you just did some shopping recently. Tell me more about like where and what you bought. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
47:13
Yeah, sure. So. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
47:17
I know that specifically I know that Bath and Body Works, they do their semiannual sale right after Christmas, so the 26th. And yeah, I went to Bath and Body Works on Friday just to see. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
47:39
Like what's going on with the sale. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:42
Got it, got it. Did you have anything specific in mind that you were trying to get or you were Like, I know that there's a sale happening and things are going to be discounted, so I'm just going to go check it out. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
47:56
Yeah, I just wanted to check it out and see how the sale is going to be. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:02
Got it. And what did you see? Like, how did you feel about, I guess the sale? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
48:14
It was not bad. I felt like. I felt like the. I felt like the sale was a little bit better in the summer, but I don't know. I'm also waiting because I'm going to go to a different mall because they have like a Bath and body. Their Bath and Body Works is kind of an outlet type of type. I'm just really curious to see how their sale compares to the. The regular mall we have here. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:49
Okay, so basically you haven't bought everything necessarily just yet because you wanted to, like, see. Okay. Can I get a better deal perhaps somewhere else? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
48:59
Well, not just a better. The deals are the same, but just like the items. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:05
Oh, okay. Gotcha. Makes sense. And what did you. I guess, what did you end up buying then when you did go? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
49:19
Yeah, I ended up buying some deodorant actually, because I've never seen Bath and Body Works sell. Like, because I really. From Bath and Body Works, I really like the Thousand Wishes and Japanese Cherry Blossom scent. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:40
Okay. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
49:41
Yeah, so I just bought. I. I didn't like. It was surprising that I saw some deodorant there of that scent. So I just got. And it was 75 off. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
49:52
So I just bought some of those. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
49:55
And then I bought. They were selling like one of their. They had back like mini like crossbody backpacks. And my best friends that. My best friend's best friend invited me to her graduation party yesterday. So I was like, okay, that's the. That can be a good kind of part of her gift. And then my mom suggested that I can put. Because I was like, I should probably maybe put like some. It would be cool if I put some items in the backpack. So I ended up putting two of those deodorants in the backpack. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:39
Gotcha. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
50:40
Yeah, that kind of just turned out to be part of the gift. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
50:46
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:46
Got it. Did. I guess. Did. Was. Were most of the things that you bought then from Bath and Body Works for other people? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
50:56
Well, originally it was supposed to be. I bought. Yeah, I bought four deodorants. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:08
Two of them were for you then? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
51:10
Yeah, well, actually no. Three of them were supposed to be for me and then one of them was supposed to be for my mom. But then, yeah, I gifted two of. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
51:21
Them and then One of them for. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
51:23
My mom and then just one for me. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:26
Okay. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
51:27
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:30
Okay, Got it. And how do you feel about what you bought? 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
51:39
It was good. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
51:40
I feel like. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
51:43
It was good. It was. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
51:44
The deodorants were 75 off. It was good price. I just hope that. Because I smelled it. I just hope the smell, like, when I use it's. It still smells like the perfume and. Yeah. Kind of has a. I just hope it has a similar smell to the perfume because I smell that it smelled. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
52:07
A little bit off, but. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
52:11
Yeah, I just hope it has a similar smell. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:13
Yeah. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
52:14
And the backpack, it was good. It was nice to show up to. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
52:19
Like, her party with the gifts. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:21
Yeah, got it. Makes sense. Let me see. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
52:35
And then I did go to another store if you wanted to. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:38
Oh, yeah. Tell me about that. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
52:44
Yeah, because were in the mall. Me and my dad were just in the mall. Yeah. It was just kind of a crazy story to get money back from Vision Works because they kind of charged us wrongly because we're supposed to get a free eye exam or we're supposed to get our free eye exam with our insurance. Yeah, they actually charged me, technically, my dad, but $84. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:23
Yeah. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
53:23
And then we just went there to get the money back, but the office was. The eye doctor office was closed. And so that's when I. I wanted to go to Bath and Body Works. Anyways. And then. Yeah, after I bought the things at Bath and Body Works, I kind of just saw Hot Topic was having seven dollar T shirts. And then. Yeah, my dad actually bought one and then I actually bought two. And that purchase made me feel really good because I already knew that I had five. A five dollar birthday reward and then a five dollar kind of anniversary award for, like, I guess. Yeah, for. For signing up in their awards. So I had a $10 reward and then I got two T shirts, two $7 T shirts. So I got two T shirts for $4 after the rewards. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:31
Yeah. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
54:32
So that made me feel really good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:35
That's. That's just. That's a really good deal. Yeah. Very cool. Are these like T shirts you wear day to day or like, hey, I'm going to, I don't know, an event and I'd wear them. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
54:49
Yeah, it's just like a casual, just graphic T shirt. I just got two squid game T shirts. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:58
Very cool. And you, like, realize it while you were at the mall, right? Like, it wasn't like. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
55:05
Yeah, it was not. I was not expecting to visit Hot Topic. I just saw the sign that for their semiannual Well, I do shop there, but I wasn't planning on going there. I just saw the sign. It says seven dollar T shirts for the. Their semiannual. I was like, okay, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:27
And if. How would you feel? If. I guess, like, we would have this site in the app. It was like, you talk to it, and then the app was basically like, good job on, like, finding a really good deal. You were able to, like, find two cool T shirts for $4. Like, would that make you feel good to remember, hey, I bought something with a good price and discount. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
55:55
Yeah, if it can. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
55:56
If it can do that. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
55:58
If it can know that I bought two. Two T shirts for $4 and not because. I don't know, I guess I don't know how I would figure out that I spent, like, I bought two T shirts for $4. Like, I think maybe it would just see that I spent $4 at Hot Topic, but if it can figure that out and say that it's. I did a good job, it would. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
56:27
Yeah, it would be pretty good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:29
Yeah. I think the. Unless the receipt gets sent to your email, it won't know if you bought two T shirts. It will know that you spent $4, which is really quite inexpensive for Hot Topic. And it'll probably just ask you, like, hey, like, were you able to get stuff on discount? And you would just tell it, but then it can tell you, like, hey, it's good that you got this on discount. So then you can see all the other stuff you got on discount, which includes bath and body works. Right. 75. Got it. Cool. I know we have just a minute left, but I just want to say thank you for your time, Yalda. That's all the questions that I have. We will get back. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
57:14
We'll. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:14
We'll basically settle the whole gift cards process and everything, because this is concluding the second conversation that we had. And if we have anything else that comes up that you can help us with, we'll reach out. But thank you so much for spending time with us and sharing. 
Y
Yalda Sabounchi
57:29

Y
Yalda Sabounchi
57:34

Sherry Jiang
