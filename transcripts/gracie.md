G
gracie
00:04
Hi. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:05
Yes, I can hear you perfectly. Thanks for. Yeah, thanks for being patient and waiting. I was just running a bit late for my. For my last call. How are you doing? 
G
gracie
00:15
I'm good. How are you? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:16
Yeah, I'm doing well. Where are you based out of? 
G
gracie
00:20
I live in North Carolina. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:21
Okay, gotcha. Well, thank you so much for staying on. I guess on the later side of things, it's like 9pm where you're at. 
G
gracie
00:29
Yeah. But there's no worries. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:31
Got it. And are you from North Carolina, like originally or like, did you move there? 
G
gracie
00:37
Yeah, I've lived here my whole life. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:40
Very cool. You know, I have to say I think I've only been once, but. 
G
gracie
00:44
Oh, nice. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:45
What was it? I think it borders the Smoky Mountains. Right. I'm not incorrect. 
G
gracie
00:50
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:51
Because it's been like a really long time. Like I think nine when I went. So. Yeah, it's been like, you know, maybe a few decades, but I remember it was very beautiful. Anyways. Yeah, yeah, it was. It's great to meet you. I'll do like a quick intro before, you know, we get into things. So I'm Sherry and I'm doing research for a company called Peak. We're looking to understand more in depth how different people who are young, working professionals are like, making money slash life decisions and seeing where like, technology could be more helpful in that regard. And the purpose of this call today, we're going to divide into two parts. One part will be A, like, you know, Q and A just to like, get to know you a little bit better. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:41
And the second part, we're going to be using an AI to kind of digest some of your own spending insights. And then, you know, us just kind of talking through it. So it's. Yeah, so that's what that part will be. I'll give you instructions on how that will work before we get started. Do you have any questions? 
G
gracie
02:04
Not really. I did want to state though, I do have the Peak app downloaded, but I noticed today it's like not loading. Like it is loading, but it's not generating my thing, if that makes sense. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:17
Yeah, yeah, that's okay. We're not going to be. We're not going to be using the PGAP during focus interview. So don't worry about it. Thanks for downloading, but yeah, we won't need it for today, so. Yeah, gotcha. No problem. 
G
gracie
02:29
Okay, nice. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:31
Cool. So just to kick things off then, can you tell me a little bit more about yourself? So you're, you know, Carolina native. Like, what do you. What do you do right now? What do you enjoy doing for fun? All that stuff? Yeah. 
G
gracie
02:48
Yeah. So I'm 25, and then. Yes, I live in North Carolina. I work at Fidelity Investments, and I've been working there for like three and a half years almost. I'm also a student, so I'm in grad school. And as far as things I like to do for fun, like on my free time, I like to bake, crochet, do Pilates, hang out with friends. So. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:17
Yeah. Cool. What are you studying in grad school right now? 
G
gracie
03:23
It's completely unrelated to what I do for work. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:26
That's okay. 
G
gracie
03:26
Yeah, yeah. So my undergrad was psychology, and so my master's is for clinical counseling, so mental health therapy. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:35
Gotcha. And are you working at. I guess, like, I'm guessing your, like, career aspiration isn't just to work in finance and you're. You're doing it for now as a job or are you trying to combine the two to some extent? Like, I'm. I'm kind of curious. Yeah. 
G
gracie
03:53
Yeah. Definitely didn't think I would ever work in finance, but when I was like a junior, an undergrad, I got an opportunity to work for Fidelity Investments. And I didn't want to turn it down because I was like, how many people get a job, like, before graduating? 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:11
Yeah, yeah. 
G
gracie
04:11
So I took it. And so I like the company. That's just kind of why I ended up there. I would stay, I don't know, it depends. Like, there's a small part of me that would stay long term, but I would definitely, like, the focus is definitely my, like, career and counseling. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:28
Yeah, gotcha. And I guess what's your role. What's your role in Fidelity right now? 
G
gracie
04:38
So right now the role is an at risk customer response manager. So it's like, in regards to, like, risk and fraud prevention. Oh, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:48
Gotcha. 
G
gracie
04:50
Oh. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:51
Quite different than what you were studying, but I'm sure there's like, interesting things you can learn. Yeah, yeah. And what's, I guess, like, when it comes to, like, your longer term career aspirations? You said clinical psychological therapy earlier. What sparked that? Like, what was, I guess the. Yeah. Driving force behind that direction you picked? 
G
gracie
05:17
I would say I kind of noticed I wanted to do that in high school, so I think it was like junior, senior year of high school, I took an AP psych class. I guess, like, right before I took that class, I was like, oh, I really, like. Well, actually it first started off with me, like, in biology. Yeah. And I was like, oh, I don't really. So I like kind of lean into like. Well, what about like human biology? 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:38
So yeah. Yeah, okay. 
G
gracie
05:40
Like psychology is kind of like that. So I took an AP psych class. I really liked the class. People would always tell me like, oh, you get good advice. I feel like you should be like a therapist. So, I actually decided to pursue it. And then like, when I thought about it, I feel like it meets my needs the best as far as the career goes. Like, there's flexibility. I help people. So Yeah, I just felt like once I realized that there wasn't really another career, I felt like I would want to do long term. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:07
Yeah, yeah, that, that makes sense. And I also think understanding how people think is one of the like, least understood. I think parts of human biology. Like the brain is super complicated and there's still. 
G
gracie
06:22
Yeah, yeah, that's what was intriguing to me. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:27
And right now are you living at home or do you live with roommates? By yourself? With a partner? Like, what's the. Yeah. What's the situation? 
G
gracie
06:37
Yeah, so I still live at home with my mom. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:40
Gotcha, Gotcha. And when it comes to, I guess, like how you like manage your, I guess, spending and like all that on a day to day basis, what are the primary areas that you are spending on? I mean, you mentioned Pilates, so I'm sure there's like, you know, classes, hobbies, obviously. Because you mentioned like baking, crocheting. I'm sure it's not like crazy, but like, you know, ingredients like maybe yarn and crochet with yarn. Yeah, I think you do crochet with yarn. But yeah, I would love to just like understand like what your like kind of like what your life is like and then how you kind of allocate and spend your money accordingly for that. 
G
gracie
07:24
Yeah. So I do like kind of track. Well, I track how much I spend a week, but I don't necessarily track like what I spend it on. But I would say the most, like something I spend the most on like every week would be groceries. So I go grocery shopping every week. And then I would say I like to buy clothes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:49
Yeah, of course. 
G
gracie
07:52
As far as like hobbies go, like, yeah, I'll buy like some things for baking. I feel like that's not like super. Well, aside from butter. Butter can become expensive. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:03
Oh, is it? Actually? Yeah, maybe. And then at one point eggs. And eggs could be expensive too. 
G
gracie
08:09
Yeah. And then I would say like maybe the main. Well, those are the main things. But then aside from that, like maybe just like General experiences, like if I'm hanging out with friends, like, maybe, like, spending money on dinner or like, recurring subscriptions that I have. Yeah, that's what I would say. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:28
Gotcha. Gotcha. Seems like, generally speaking, like, you would be doing most of your, like, I guess, eating from, like, groceries you buy versus, like, I guess, buying lunch. 
G
gracie
08:43
It depends. Depends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:45
Okay. 
G
gracie
08:46
Yeah, it depends because I work in the office. Like, back and forth. Like, one week's in office, when he's at home. If I work from home, I feel like I don't really spend much on eating up, but if I work in the office, I do. Just depends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:00
Okay, so when you, I guess, like, work from the office, then you're more likely to, like, I guess, pick up lunch or, like, buy lunch out because you're, like, not home. 
G
gracie
09:11
Yeah. Or dinner. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:12
Okay, got it. Yeah, I guess, like, out of these, right? Like, which ones did you spend money on that, like, brought you a lot of joy or, like, made you feel like it was. Was really worth it? Like, I enjoy spending money here. 
G
gracie
09:29
I think if I had to choose, like, I definitely. I definitely find more joy in, like, buying clothes. I feel like it's more of, like, an investment. So, like, I buy it, I keep it. Yeah, I would say clothes. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:45
Gotcha. Where do you buy. Where do you spend money on that? You. You, like, it's not as worth it or like, you don't enjoy it as much? 
G
gracie
09:56
Like, in general, like, things that I spend money on that I feel like it's like, it's not that worth it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:01
Yeah. Not that worth it or, like. Yeah, it doesn't really spark that joy or emotion. 
G
gracie
10:09
I guess. Bills. Yes. To choose something. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:13
Yeah. 
G
gracie
10:14
Like my car payment. Yeah, I guess. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:16
Yeah, it makes sense. Tell me more about, like, I guess, like, buying what? Like, I guess, like, like, where and when you, like, buy clothes, like, do you, like. I guess, do you browse stuff regularly? Is it like a. You buy stuff online? Like, what were some of the last few things you bought? 
G
gracie
10:40
Yeah, yeah, I'm regularly browsing things just to see you guys, like, sales. And then the last thing I bought was probably like a week or so ago. I bought a pair of shorts because they were on sale. But I normally do most of my shopping online. I would say, like 80 of it is online and 20 is in person. And then I also like to buy skincare as well, like hair makeup. So I'll add that as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:10
Yeah, got it. And when you. When you're browsing, like, online, like, what are Some places that you like, I guess, go to regularly to look at stuff. 
G
gracie
11:22
So Abercrombie for clothing, Amazon, Ulta, Sephora, I would say those are, like, the top four that I browse, like, kind of daily to see if there's anything on sale. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:35
Okay, gotcha. There's this. Is this stuff on sale, like, pretty often? 
G
gracie
11:43
Yeah, it depends. I mean, like, with clothing, like, Abercrombie always has a sale, but if your size is. There is another story. So. Yeah. Yeah. And then, like, Sephora and Ulta, sometimes they'll have, like, random sales, sometimes there's no sale, and then sometimes if there is a sale, like, it's the same sale for, like, a week, so it's not really different. Amazon. I mean, like, it kind of just depends. Like, sometimes I'll have stuff in my cart or, like, saved for later and I'll see if there's, like, a small sale. But, yeah, it just depends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:11
Got it. Do you. Do you ever buy things at full price or you're like, no, like, I have to wait to a sale because, like, I'm just leaving money on the table. 
G
gracie
12:20
Clothing, I refuse to buy full price because I don't know it's gonna go. Yeah, but skincare and makeup and, like, hair care, like, if I really need it, I have no choice. Like, I just have to buy it. I might try to wait and see if it goes on sale, but, like, there are obviously some products that, like, never go on sale. Yeah, it just depends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:41
Yeah, gotcha. So when it comes to, like, I guess, skin care, right? Like, how much would you say you're, like, buying stuff that's, like, more like, hey, this is like, my regular. Right? Like, I, I. My regular staple. Like, this is what, you know, keeps Gracie running. How much would you say is, like, experimental, where you're like, you know, I just like to try something. Like, let's see if it works out. And like, oh, this is maybe a new color or, like, new thing I found, and, like, let's give it a shot. 
G
gracie
13:08
Yeah, so I would say, like, it kind of depends. Like, I feel like I go through seasons, so, like, maybe I'll find a product. Like, I think, like, like, maybe two, three months ago, I decided to buy, like, replace certain skincare products because I wanted to try something new to see if it would work better. Yeah, I feel like what I tend to do is, like, maybe like, a random month out of the year, out of the season, I will replace a couple products. But then for the most part, like, once I replace products, I do tend to keep them and like, I keep repurchasing those same ones. Yeah. Unless I start to feel like, okay, like, this isn't really working that well. There's a better product. Let me try it. 
G
gracie
13:48
So I wouldn't say that I really, like, seek out buying new things all the time. I try to, like, stick to a good product. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:56
Okay. 
G
gracie
13:58
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:00
Yeah. 
G
gracie
14:01
Make. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:01
Makes sense. And also, I think with skin care, it's like, if it doesn't work out, it, like, it's not. It might cause breakouts or like, things like that. I think clothes is just like, oh, color's not on me. Yes. It's like lifting. Yeah. What would you say, like, are some recent discoveries that you made on, like, beauty or skincare products that was like something new that you tried and you were like, wow, this is great. Like, I'm. I'm so happy with this and I'm gonna switch to it. 
G
gracie
14:35
There was this. So there was. First there was this retinol serum that I bought like two, three months ago that was like, I haven't tried that many retinol serums. But this one I felt like was really nice. So I plan to do it. And then my friend gifted me this moisturizer for Christmas. And it's actually surprisingly really, like, moisturizing. I'm like, really picky when it comes to facial moisturizers. Like, I don't want anything that's going to make my face look greasy. But also I have dry skin, so I need to make sure it's actually moisturizing. And this one is like just that. And a little goes a long way, which I was surprised. So those are like the two recent products that I feel like I'll probably stick to. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:17
Gotcha. Gotcha. And I guess when it comes to then the clothes side of things, how would you say, like, you divide between, like, the. This is my, like, must buy functional things. I guess with clothes, like, it might be more like, I guess the necessity. More necessity. Things are like, oh, like the seasons are changing. I need to buy a jacket or like, I need to buy boots or whatever. Right. Versus like, things that are more like, oh, I saw this, it's kind of cute. And like, I just want to buy it. How would you classify, like, how you spend on clothes? 
G
gracie
15:57
Yeah. So I. Well, depends. Sometimes I will go like a few months and I'll tell myself, like, I don't need anything. Like, I, like, I'll only buy a piece of clothing if I feel like I need to. So I'll tell myself, like, let's say I want a new pair of jeans. Like, why do I want a new pair of jeans? Like, are they too small now? Are they too big? If that's the case, then maybe I can justify buying a new pair of jeans if there's, like, no justification behind it and I just want, like, a new pair of jeans or, like, a new pair of shorts. I will tell myself that I need to get rid of another pair. 
G
gracie
16:31
So I try to, like, tell myself, like, okay, there's this one pair that I haven't been wearing, or, like, there's this one shirt that I haven't been wearing. Like, let me sell that one so that I can buy anyone. Just because, like, I'm at a point where I have way too many clothes, so I can't keep, like, stuffing my clothes. So I need to, like, get rid of something one way or another. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:50
Yeah, got it. Do you normally, when you get rid of stuff, do you, like, try to sell it? 
G
gracie
16:56
Oh, yes, I do try to sell it. All right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:58
That's pretty savvy. Where do you actually end up selling it? 
G
gracie
17:01
I use a few platforms, so either Depop, Mercari, sometimes ebay, and then there's this other app called Curtsy. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:11
Okay, gotcha. Yeah, I mean, that. That's good value. Meaning, like, I guess you might as well get something for it if you don't. 
G
gracie
17:19
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:21
Kind of, like, pay for a bit of the. The new piece of clothing you get. And you mentioned, like, I have, like, you said, I have way too many clothes. Like, can you describe, like, visually, like, what. Like, what happened? Do you open your closet, you're like, oh, wow. Like, I have too much of this one thing. I have too much of stuff in general. I have too much stuff I don't wear. Like, what was going through your head when you, like, I guess, checked your closet? 
G
gracie
17:51
Yeah. So I feel like it really is just, like, I wouldn't. I don't know. I don't know. I feel like everyone has a different, like, explanation for too many clothes. I feel like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:02
What's yours? Yeah, what's yours? 
G
gracie
18:03
Yeah, I would say I have slightly too many clothes. I feel like to most people that are not, like, shopaholics, it's probably a lot of clothes. Like, I'm pretty sure I have, like. I don't know. I probably have, like, 12 pairs of pants, and, like, I know I've got a whole bunch of shirts. And I categorize my closet to where, like, shorts are in one section, jeans are in one section, pants are in one Section. Dresses are in one section. Yeah, skirts and also, like, dresses. Like, I haven't bought a dress in the past year because I am pretty sure I have, like 20 dresses. So. Yeah, that's. That's what I would say. So my closet is like a walk in closet, but it's not like a huge walk in closet. 
G
gracie
18:44
It just has like one long rack one side and then a little bit of a shorter rack on the other side. Both are full. And then also my dressers are full of clothes too, so. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:54
Yeah, got it. And do you find yourself, like, buying stuff that you don't end up using that much when it comes to, like, clothes? Or is it more like a seasonal rotation type of thing where you, like, I guess, buy something, you wear it a lot, and then, like, you move on? Yeah. 
G
gracie
19:13
Yes. Yeah. I mean, I. So when I buy stuff, I am the type of person, like, if I buy something, I'm gonna wear it right away if the season allows. I try not to let clothes, like, sit in my closet for too long. But if there is, like, that rare occasion where, like, something has sat in my closet and I like, think to myself, I'm like, okay, I haven't worn this in a while. I will intentionally try to wear it some more. Or maybe I'll realize, okay, maybe I shouldn't have bought this, and then I'll sell it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:44
Got it. Got it. So it's, I guess, like, it's. It's rare that you will buy something and it, like, sits there and you don't at least wear it like, once right after. 
G
gracie
19:57
Right, that. That would be correct. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:59
Got it. Got it. Let's see. And what would you say, like. Like when you decide what you want to buy for clothes, how do you balance between, like, I guess, the attractiveness of the deal versus, like, how much something, like, draws you in just based on the aesthetic itself? Is it like, oh, you find something you really like and then you see if it's on sale, or is it like, I look for, like, what's on sale and then I make the decision whether or not it fits my, I guess, style? 
G
gracie
20:37
Yeah, I kind of do both. So sometimes I, like, specifically look for things on sale, but just because it's on sale doesn't mean that I'll buy. And then like, yeah, if there's something that's, like, not on sale that I really like, I feel like it's gonna be really flattering. I might still buy it even if it's not on sale. If it's worth It Gotcha. Cool. And then. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:03
Okay, now, like, I guess taking a step away from just talking about shopping, you also said you enjoy, like, spending on, like, general experiences, like eating out. Like, could you tell me more about that? Like, is it like dinners with friends, you know, certain time of the week? Concerts? Like, what's that look like? 
G
gracie
21:26
Yeah, so it's either like dinner with friends. Yes. Concerts. Or like mini vacations with my friends or with my boyfriend. Yeah, that's what I would say for that. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:44
Makes sense. Okay, so for the next part of this, we're going to have you, I guess if you have like a recent bank, credit card or like bank statement, whatever you spend money on, like, obviously it depends. What we're going to do is we're going to go into ChatGPT. If you have an account there and I have a prompt you can run to, basically do some like, quick, like, summary on, like, how you spend and then we'll basically go over, like, your thoughts and reactions to it. Do you have chat GPT or like a AI that you use? 
G
gracie
22:23
I do. I have chat GPT. Perfect. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:27
So feel free to like. Yeah, take your time and assembling something. I'm gonna send you the prompt you can use. 
G
gracie
22:35
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:36

I just sent it in a chat. 
G
gracie
22:38
Yeah. Okay. All right, so let me see. So I said, I assume I will get like a. Like a. Like save a bank statement and then send it to chat DPT and ask that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:55
Yes, correct. 
G
gracie
22:56
Okay. Okay, I will just need to find that. It. Okay, I will need to get a code for my bank. So I'm gonna have to go really quick because it's gonna, like, call me. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:17
Yeah, it's all good. No worries. 
G
gracie
24:19
Okay, thank you. Okay, sorry, I'm almost done. I just need like, two more minutes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:59
Yeah, no worries. Take your time. 
G
gracie
27:01
Okay, thanks. Okay, so I'm about to send it. So just copy and paste the entirety of what you said and put it in CHAT GPT. Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:43
And then when you're ready, like, would love to. Yeah. If you can share your screen and walk through it, that'd be great. 
G
gracie
29:49
Okay. Right. It's just analyzing, so. Okay, I will share my screen now. Okay. Are you able to see my screen? 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:30
Yes, I can see your screen. It's in the meeting right now. Yes, It's a little blurry, but. Oh, okay. I can see it a bit better now. 
G
gracie
30:41
Okay. Is it. Is it better? Is it readable? 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:45
Yeah, yeah, it's readable. So, yeah, I guess just like, go through it, like, you know, whatever reaction comes to Mind, just say it out loud. Things that, like, you're like. Okay, that tracks. Things that surprise you, things that don't. 
G
gracie
31:01
Yeah. So I will also say that this is just from my, like, general checking account, not factoring in credit cards, but this is typically the card I use the most. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:12
Okay. 
G
gracie
31:13
Yeah, but the Trader Joe's, like, being on top definitely makes sense. Starbucks makes sense too. Let's see. Shopping. I feel like that makes sense. Food delivery also makes sense. I don't really order food delivery that often. Now, the coffee is a little surprising. Like, I didn't realize I spent that much time. Coffee in a month, So. And then the groceries. I kind of didn't think I spent that much of a month either on groceries. Okay. But aside from that, everything makes sense. I'm just surprised at the total amounts. For a couple things. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:26
What do you normally expect would be the spending on grocery or, like, I guess you said you're surprised about the amount. 
G
gracie
32:36
Yeah, I guess I just say that because, like, if I, like, if someone asked me how much I spend on groceries a month, I wouldn't think 400. I would probably think, like, oh, like maybe like 250 or something. But it could also have just been because it was December, like, it was Christmas. It does say Trader Joe's was, like, right at 250. So maybe December was just, like an outlier month. I'm not sure. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:00
Yeah, gotcha. Do you normally spend at, like, only Trader Joe's and the other places are, like, a bit more unusual? Like, how do you. Yeah, like, what's the. 
G
gracie
33:26
Like for groceries? 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:27
Yeah, yeah, for groceries, yeah. 
G
gracie
33:30
Yes. Trader Joe's is definitely, like, where I'll go for most things. Now we. I do also go to Costco once a month. So actually that actually adds. That would add more to what I spend a month. But I don't use my debit card for Costco. I use my credit card for. For Costco. So that's not even included in this. So I guess the grocery amount, it will. It would go up. So, yeah, so I go to Trader Joe's and Costco the most. And then sometimes I'll go to Publix, Sometimes I'll go to Aldi's, or sometimes I'll go to Target or Whole Foods. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:04
Yeah. Do you have any, like, I guess, any guesses as to why you think it might be higher in December or, like, not really quite sure. 
G
gracie
34:17
Like I said, all I can think of is because it was Christmas. Like, there were also some things I got from Trader Joe's as Gifts because they have like snacks. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:24
Right. 
G
gracie
34:25
And also the Publix total, I think that was like what I bought for Christmas dinner. So. Okay. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:35
Okay, gotcha. But I mean, if it helps, you can actually ask. Ask Chad GPT to list it by date because it actually can tell you if publics actually happen around Christmas. It might be it. 
G
gracie
34:54
Okay, let me see if I can ask that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:20
Is it hanging? 
G
gracie
35:21
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, the Christmas one. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:26
Yeah, this sounds like Christmas. Okay. 
G
gracie
35:28
Yeah, yeah. But everything else seems pretty accurate. But it is also like still missing some stuff because I like I said I don't put everything one card, so. But this is like a general like, I guess the best way to be. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:50
Yeah, like this would like be the. Would you say it's like 80% representative? 
G
gracie
35:56
I would say like, I would say like. Yeah, I guess I would say like 70 or 80. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:02
Okay, that's probably okay. What, what do you think is not represented here besides like Costco? 
G
gracie
36:11
There are some like purchases like for clothes that I'll use my credit card for. I mean I also, I know it's not really like touched on, but I paid and I guess I wouldn't have done this in December, but I pay for my tuition. That would not go here. Yeah. And like, I guess it's like everything that's mentioned here is still the same. Like sometimes maybe I'll use my credit card for food or sometimes like one Trader Joe's visit I'll use my credit card. But mostly everything is with this debit card. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:50
Gotcha. Gotcha. 
G
gracie
36:52
I think. Look. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:53
So looking at this, right, like what would you say is an area of spend where like, you like looking at these numbers now in front of you. Like you don't feel as good about that. You're like, I maybe should think twice on this or I'll think about it more later. 
G
gracie
37:12
I would say the coffee one because I like, I guess seeing $51, I don't even know how I spent $20 at Dutch Bros. But $70 on coffee in a month. I feel like it's a little more than I would have thought. Yeah. The shopping is also a bit concerning only because I know that this is not the true amount because I've used like my credit card likely has some shopping transactions too. So this amount is less than what it actually is. But again, it was Christmas and some of those were also gifts. So that's why I said I don't know if that's like a true representation, but I think that would be like the most like the top two ones. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:56
Yeah. So like basically if you had, if you wanted to like examine in more and just like see like, okay, like what's going on here or what's like, I guess spend that makes sense versus something that I might want to revisit. It's just, it's mostly coffee and shopping right now. 
G
gracie
38:18
Correct. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:20
Got it. 
G
gracie
38:28
Let me see. Else. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:39
Any, any other thoughts that like pop into your head as you're looking at this that you like haven't shared yet? 
G
gracie
38:51
Not really. I mean, I guess I'm surprised. I feel like this is kind of not categorized correctly because Paula's choice. I don't know if I would categorize that under health. I feel like I'd categorize that under shopping. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:03
Okay. So this would be more shopping than fitness. 
G
gracie
39:07
Right. None of this would be fitness related. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:10
I see. 
G
gracie
39:12
So that's the only thing that I would point out. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:20
For let's. I guess that's like think about like the shopping spend. Like what would help you understand, I guess the shopping category. Better to I guess make a proper decision around like what kind of habit or what kind of way you would be doing things moving forward. Right. 
G
gracie
39:45
Well, first to get like a true shopping breakdown, I would need to include one of my credit cards to actually see like the true total amount. If I were to do that, I would probably like ask it to like list all of the retailers and the prices I feel like seeing that would probably make me realize maybe I could cut back on certain things. Yeah. Because like the more I look at this, I, I know it's like missing stuff, so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:15
Yeah. 
G
gracie
40:16
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:18
Do you have, do you have actually the statement for like where you do your other shopping? 
G
gracie
40:26
I can get it. I would just need to log into that financial institution. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:33
Yeah. Because what we can do is we can just add that and then ask it to then break down all of my shopping spend by the merchant so you can actually see a clean list. 
G
gracie
40:46
Yeah, I'll do that because I'm also curious. So let me try to. Yeah, take your time. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:06
While you're doing that. If you don't mind, I'm going to quickly use the bathroom. I'll be back. 
G
gracie
41:11
Yeah, no, you're fine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:27
Oh, by the way, I'm back. I'm just ready whenever you are, but take your time. 
G
gracie
43:31
Okay, perfect. It is actually updating the calculation now. Okay. So there I feel like now I. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:40
Have a more. 
G
gracie
43:43
Accurate. Okay. So I added is now putting the shopping at $900. Okay. Which I feel like makes More sense. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:06
So what you can do now is you can ask it. Hey, can you just list down all of my shopping transactions in chronological order with the merchant and amount so that will, like, show you, like, what the month look like. It's easier to kind of remember that way. Yeah, actually, you can also. Okay, never mind. I was gonna say. No, no, it's fine. Sometimes it helps to add day of the week because, like. 
G
gracie
44:40
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:41
Yeah, I think it's. I don't know if this helps. Actually ask it. Can you put this in a table view and add the days of the week alongside the date? 
G
gracie
44:58
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:13
Yeah, I just find this a bit easier. 
G
gracie
45:15
Like. Yeah, okay, I agree. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:18
All right. This is. Yeah, so, yeah, this is the. 
G
gracie
45:23
Okay. Oh, you know, you can go ahead. What are you going to say? 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:27
No, like, yeah, just feel free to take a look and just like, share what's going on in your head as you're, like, looking at this. 
G
gracie
45:39
Yeah. So this does look more accurate. Again, I'm pretty sure, like, a couple of these were gifts and most of my shopping last month was on Amazon. And, like, honestly, like, half of it is Amazon, so. Yes, this makes more sense. This is also interesting to see to. Yeah, I guess this makes sense because I don't. I feel like I don't really have like a day where I'll just like go all in and shop. I kind of just randomly, like, again, if I find something that I eat or something on sale, I'll just kind of randomly buy it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:36
Yeah. For the stuff on Amazon was. How would you, I guess, classify those between, like, things you, like, needed to buy gifts or like, other category? Yeah. 
G
gracie
46:55
Well, I'm trying to think maybe. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:59
Also it can help if you just tell. It just said show me the table with just Amazon. Because I know it's like, kind of hard to see. Yeah. 
G
gracie
47:13
Okay, let me see. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:19
Yeah, it's a bit cleaner. 
G
gracie
47:20
Okay. I would say that, like, maybe I can't. It's hard to tell. I don't think I really bought any gifts on Amazon. Like, maybe I bought a couple. So this might not really have involved any gifts. So this was most likely all things that I needed. Like, things that I needed to restock on. Like, I know for a fact, like, I needed, like, parchment paper and like, I needed like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:47
Yeah. 
G
gracie
47:47
Other things for like, baking. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:50
Right, right. 
G
gracie
47:52
So, yeah, I would say that's probably what this mostly all is. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:56
Okay. So it's a kind of needs restocking and like a bit of hobby spend. 
G
gracie
48:01
Right, right. And maybe like a couple of Things were gifts that I'm just not remembering what specifically they were. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:08
Yeah, gotcha. Does, I guess, like, when you look at this, like, do you feel like, how do you feel about the total amount? Like, do you feel like, okay, like, this is fine? Or do you feel like, okay, like, maybe there was somewhere I could maybe have cut back a little bit? 
G
gracie
48:30
Like, the individual totals don't really seem like that big of a deal. They're not. Like, each total is relatively, like, normal to me. I guess that's more so just like the frequency of, like, me placing orders. Like, there's like over 10 orders, like, 10 separate orders for. From Amazon, and most of these orders already included, like, one or two items. So I guess it's more so like, maybe if I. I feel like if I actually went back and looked at everything, I would wonder, did I actually need. Look that, like, I don't know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:05
Yeah, I think, like, when. When the amounts are smaller, it's. It's almost like it. It doesn't really stand out until you look at it all together, I guess, in a way. 
G
gracie
49:14
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:17
Yeah. Yeah. Probably. It's probably hard to remember exactly what you got then. 
G
gracie
49:26
I. I mean, I could probably look, but I. I don't remember what each one was like. I feel like the only one I remember is probably, like, the December 16th or the December 1st one was probably the parchment paper, because I know that's how much that costs, but I don't remember what anything else was. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:49
Got it. 
G
gracie
49:50
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:52
Yeah. Actually, I mean, you don't have to do this now, but later on, I think Amazon usually does have, like, receipts sent to your email, so it can help. Although it is definitely a hassle to put it together, but, like, that's. It's so easy to. Yeah, it's. It's. It's a. It's pretty normal because it's just like there's so many different orders that are small, but it. I guess it sometimes, like. Yeah. Can add up a bit. 
G
gracie
50:20
Yeah. I do also think it's because now that I remember, I did go snowboarding December. I think some of those, like, later transactions, like, the. More like the 61, I think that was probably, like, the snowboarding gear that I had to buy. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:37
Right. Okay. So, like, the 22nd one, right? 
G
gracie
50:43
Yeah. And I think there was like, maybe, like, now that I'm remembering, there definitely was a gift in there that I bought. The 22nd was likely the snowboarding gear, and then the rest was like, the. Just Restocks. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:59
Okay, gotcha. I guess so now, like, looking at the other stuff, like, if you scroll back up, I'm just trying to see, like, what's the next biggest one besides Amazon? Okay. I guess Birkenstock was like, the one you mentioned. 
G
gracie
51:22
Yeah, that one was a gift. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:25
Yeah. 
G
gracie
51:25
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:27
Do you roughly know, like, how much you spent on gift versus, like, yourself? 
G
gracie
51:38
Well, the Birkenstock1 is 176. Maybe this one was also a gift. Okay, so these ones were likely, like, for me, aside from the Birkenstock one. This one was likely for me. This one was likely me. I feel like this was probably me, too. Like, everything else was probably me, aside from this one. Ebay one. The. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:03
Was it. Ebay was a gift, right? 
G
gracie
52:06
Yes. This was American Eagle. That was a gift. The Birkenstock was a gift. And I think that would probably have been it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:19
Okay, what was Sephora? 
G
gracie
52:22
Sephora. I think that one would have been mine. I think that one was mine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:31
Okay, gotcha. 
G
gracie
52:32
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:48
So actually a good portion of it is actually for gifts, then? Seems like probably. Yeah, it seems like at least, like, maybe 3, 400 is for gifts. If I were, I guess, roughly guessing. Ish, I would say maybe, like. 
G
gracie
53:09
Yeah, I don't know if I would say, like, that much. Well, this one's okay. So this one and then the, like, this one puts it kind of like at 200. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:16
Okay. 
G
gracie
53:17
EBay1. If it was that one, I think it was that one, I guess puts it like, almost at 240. I would say, like 250. Okay. Likely for gifts. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:26
Gotcha. So then 900 by 250. Okay. So basically, 650 was shopping for yourself, right? 
G
gracie
53:33
Correct. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:34
Okay. And so I guess, like, looking at, like, the individual stuff and now looking at the totals, like, how do you overall, like, I guess, feel about the shopping spend that you had? Like, you feel like, hey, it was. It's okay. Like, it's. Yeah. Like, and if, by the way, if you're like, this is cool, like, that's all, that's also fine. 
G
gracie
54:01
So I have a budget that I give myself to spend every month that I try to, like, keep. Technically, this is within that budget. However, the budget in question is not supposed to be, like, just shopping. It's also supposed to, like, include, like, groceries and, like, gas and stuff. So I don't feel like it's the end of the world, but could I. Could I come back? Definitely. For sure. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:29
Yeah. Got it. So it's like, it's not the biggest thing, but you're also like, okay. There could be some areas at some point that could be cut back. 
G
gracie
54:40
Right. Okay, Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:46
Well, thank you so much for doing this and, like, being so open about it. Yeah, that's actually it in terms of my questions. So, like, you know, in case you're wondering, like, how we're going to use all of this, I mean, we're trying to build a. We're trying to build an app that is different than, like, most budget trackers out there, where we don't want to just show data, but, like, really try to understand the behavior behind why people spend certain ways to, like, either help people, like, you know, intentionally look at stuff and be like, I care about this. I prioritize this. I feel good about spending it here. And then for things that don't feel like, you know, best represent the things you care about, what you're spending on, like, highlight what those are. Because the. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:35
I mean, my philosophy with budgeting isn't like, oh, less is more, and like, you always try to save, but it's more about making your money work for you and the areas that you care about. Right. And aligning to your value. So what you shared today was really useful, so I just want to thank you for. For that. 
G
gracie
55:51
Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you for having me as well. This was also insightful for me, so thank you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:56
Yeah, for sure. Thanks, Gracie. Hope you have a great day.
