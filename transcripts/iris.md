Today. 
Oh, good. How are you? 
I'm good as well. I like your hair, by the way. Is it a thank you rose gold kind of color? 
Well, it was like half of it was pink and then the other half was orange. But it's been a while. Needs a bit of a touch up. So it's. Yeah, it's kind of just become a blend of the two. 
I like it. 
Thank you. Cool. 
Well, I'll just do a quick intro on my side and what we'll be covering today and then spend most of the time just getting to know you for the purposes of this research. So I'm Sherry and I'm doing research for a company called Peak. We're in this space of understanding how young adults are making decisions in their 20s, especially around topics like money. And this particular study will, or this conversation will be in two parts. First part will be general set of questions to just understand you and how you think about money and the decisions you've made. And then second part of it, we'll run through an exercise with your actual spending. 
So there'll be a, there'll be like a GPT ChatGPT prompt that I'm going to send you for this exercise, but the instructions will be more clear when we get to that stage. Any questions before we get started? 
No, that all sounds good. 
Okay, cool. So first question, tell me more about yourself, where you live, what you do for a living right now, all of that stuff. 
Yeah, I'm 24, I live in Queens, New York and for work In like a project management type role in the music industry. Mostly doing like production for large scale events, mostly music festivals. Also, you know, a few other areas too, like film events, conferences, but mostly in the music scene. Yeah. So that's a little bit about me. 
Got it. And are you from, I guess New York originally or did you move there like for school after graduation here? 
A little bit less than three years ago now, I think. I, I grew up in Dallas, Texas, went to school in Austin and now I'm here. Okay. 
What made you decide to move to New York? 
My girlfriend is a native New Yorker, grew up in Manhattan.  so yeah, it just made sense. We were doing long distance. 
Yeah, for sure. And how do you like New York so far? I'm sure it's a little different than. 
Yeah, yeah, it definitely takes some getting used to. Yeah, I love it. I'm super like adhd so you know, just the like never ending revolving door of like things to do people to me like Is really, like, really fits my personality, but it definitely takes getting used to. It's like a big culture shock for sure. 
Yeah. I hope also, I hope you're surviving the winter storm. Yeah, like, it's. I saw some videos. 
Yeah. Yeah. I've kind of just been like, bunkered in for the last week. Yeah, I. Yeah, from coming from Texas, if It's like below 50 degrees, I just like, don't go outside. 
Yeah, it's all good. I'm from California, so anytime it gets like super cold or whatever, it's like nobody knows how to deal with anything. 
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. I see people, like, skiing and like, snowboarding. Like, I saw like, videos of people, like, doing it on the streets in Manhattan. I'm good. 
Yeah. And how did you get into, like, the music industry? Was it something that you, like, always wanted to do or, like, kind of fell into it? Like, what's that story? 
A little combination of both. Just like, as a teenager, I got really into music. I was playing guitar and yeah, I, you know, at the time thought that was what I wanted to do. Turns out I'm not very creative and I'm not a very good musician. But I really liked just like the back end side of things. There was like a period in high school where I was in a band and I was kind of like handling all the, like, business side of things, you know, producing shows and stuff like that.  so, yeah, I ended up really, like, falling in love with that side of things.  so. So, yeah, it was kind of something that, like, I had to some degree always, like, known that I wanted to do something like, creative, you know. 
And then when I found like, the music industry, like, it just felt like a right fit for me. How I exactly got into, like, the festival industry was kind of like just like a like, snowball effect of just like, you know, random chance opportunities. But yeah, so a little bit of both. 
Yeah, that's. That's super cool. And like, I guess, you know, now that you're in New York, like, is there, I guess, was there any, like, lifestyle adjustment you had to make? Because I know New York is like somewhat expensive. I mean, it's pretty expensive, like, compared to other places. So what was that like for you? 
Yeah, definitely. I'd say, like, the biggest lifestyle, like, hurdle. I think that, like, kind of like, you know, like the biggest learning curve is really just like learning how to like, restructure your life around, like, not having a car. There's just like so many things that, like, when you have a car, you don't really think about that. Like, you kind of like, take for granted, you know. Like, I was so used to, like, when I go to the grocery store, I buy like two weeks of groceries. You know, I like, haul it all into the like, trunk of my car. And like, I think about how I'm going to like, transport it from like, point A to point B. But just like, the way that people, like, grocery shop here is like, entirely different. 
It's like, you know, you just buy, like, you just pick up like one or two things, like every day, like, as you're like, walking or like, commuting between, like, work and stuff. Because, you know, like, if you like, buy a lot of things, like, you have to like, haul it all like, in your hands. You have to like, walk it up, like, several flights of stairs. Like, it's just like, you know, it's just like a completely like, different way of thinking. I think there's like a lot of things, like laundry that's like, also like that, you know, like, just like getting like, food, like, just so many things. Going to like, big box stores is like, weirdly difficult. Yeah, just like a lot of like, little lifestyle things that like, you don't really, like, think about. 
Yeah, yeah, for sure. And I guess when like, you mentioned like, getting food, right, like, is it like, harder for you to like, I guess you were mentioning, like, back then you can like, get a bunch of groceries and like, prepare for it, everything. Do you find that New York is more like. Like there's very much like a grab and go kind of culture. And like, it's harder to like, I guess, be more deliberate and plan out things like meals, etc. 
Yeah, it's definitely like a lot more like on the go. I think you can kind of like, do either. But yeah, in some ways it, like, in some ways it is like a little bit more spontaneous. In other ways, like, you know, you like, do kind of have to like, plan more. You know, if, like, if you're trying to like, specifically, like, grab things on the way, like on the way back from like, work or something, then you have to like, kind of think about like, okay, like, what's my route gonna be? You know what I mean? Kind of like planning like, the timing of things around the like, transit. But yeah, so. But then, but then like other times it's like, you know, there's like a cafe right across the street from me. 
So if I'm like, oh, oops, I'm out of food, I just liter walk right across the street. So in some ways it's more spontaneous. In some ways you gotta like be a little bit more intentional about it. I think it just depends. 
Yeah, yeah. And how about like, I guess, things that you know, find yourself doing for fun in New York? Like there's so many options. I'm sure you go to a lot of industry stuff, like being in music as well. But what does your like, I guess downtime or free time look like when you go out and find things to do for fun? 
Yeah, I actually don't really. I'm actually not that involved in the industry. Like in New York City I like freelance. So my job kind of like takes me all over the country. So like, funnily enough, I like pretty much like don't do any of that when I actually. But. But yeah, in my free time I really like to go to like different events. I still love just like exploring the city too. I feel like there's like never, you know, there's like never ending things to do. And that is like. I think one of the biggest pros living in the city for me is you know, there's just like a community and like, you know, some kind of activity for like anybody and everybody. There's like, you know, there's just always like new things popping up. 
So like for a while I was going to like art workshops a lot. Like mostly like drawing type things, Some like community events. The other good thing about New York is that like, is that you know, obviously if you like aren't careful about it, you can like walk out your door and like be down like 500. But. But like on the other hand there's also like so many like free things if you like know where to look out for it. So yeah, I think that there's like a lot more things that are just like accessible. There's a lot of like free community events, that kind of thing. 
Got it. So basically it's down to like being intentional about it. 
So like, yeah, definitely. 
If you aren't careful, then okay. Oops. Like you could just send. But there's also so many options for things that are like much more like, you know, price wise. Accessible. 
Yeah, yeah, definitely. I think that's how it kind of just is for like everything here. There's just like so many people that there's kind of like bound to be like something in every category. But like the like more like affordable things like kind of. It definitely takes like more like effort and intention to like find those. But you can like, definitely, like, you can definitely, like, do life here, like, on the budget if you, like, you know, if you, like, actually try. 
Yeah, for sure. If you think about, like, let's say, the last, you know, couple months that you spent money on stuff, what were some things that you, like, spent money on that you felt, like, joy or felt like it was really worth it? 
Yeah, the last couple of months. I recently, like, moved into a new apartment, so I guess, like, some of my, like, a lot of my purchases have just been, like, you know, like, house things like furniture, you know, decor, that kind of thing. So that's, like, I don't know, you know, just trying to like, make my. Make my space at home, you know, feel, like, comfortable in it. Yeah, I don't really, like, eat out all that much. I will with, like, friends. So I guess that's, like, another area that, like, brings me joy is, like, going out and doing things with friends. Otherwise, I like, you know, try to, like, be pretty conscious about, like, you know, trying to eat more at home and not, like, spending too much money outside, trying to think. 
Yeah, I'd say those are probably, like, the main categories that I've, like, spent on the last, like, the last few months. 
Got it. And for. For your apartment, what are the kind of, like, finds that you were able to discover and, like, what kind of aesthetic, I guess, you're cultivating or. 
Yeah, yeah, I. I've kind of done, like, a mixture. Like, some things I've kind of, like, splurged on, like, nicer things that, like, I feel like, are more worth it for me. Like, I, like, bought a robot vacuum, which I've, like, never had before, and it kind of, like, hurt that it was, like, a really big price tag, but, like, now that I've had it, I'm like, oh, so worth it. Like, my floors have never been cleaner. I feel like a real adult now, but. But then, like, other things, like, you know, like, do, like, you know, buy nothing, like, Facebook Marketplace and kind of, like, look for deals. So, yeah, just kind of like, I guess, like. I guess, like, as far as, like, kind of, like, decor things, I don't know. I like, fun colors. 
Like, been doing, like, a lot of kind of like. Like, kind of, like, deep, foresty green furniture and, like, browns, you know, kind of, like, bold but still, like, natural. Yeah. I got some, like, fake plants because I really like the look, but I, like, can't keep a plant just, like. Like, for the life of me. Yeah, just. Yeah, just kind of, like, I don't know, just, like, random things I, like, come across. 
Yeah. Yeah. So mostly, like, I guess, like, beat was. It was a combination of, like, decor, like, vibe setting kind of stuff. And it sounds like some of it was, like, essential, like, functional things, like the bathroom. 
Yeah, yeah, definitely. 
Was there anything that you got that you were like, oh, this didn't quite work out the way I expected, but it's okay. I just, you know, I tried. I bought it. 
I don't think so. No. I'm trying to think. I think that, like, I. I think that everything that I've gotten so far, I mean, I guess there's been some, like, random things like, that I've gotten from, like, buy nothing or Facebook that, like, you know, I was like, this is cheap. Like, if it doesn't end up working out, then, like, it, like, then it, like, doesn't, you know, then it's like, fine. But I think, like, anything that I've, like, you know, actually like, spent money on and, like, you know, was kind of more like, selective about, like, those things have all, like, worked out how I wanted to. Yeah. Another, like, essential that I feel like, has been, like, really great. I bought, like, a portable washing machine, which I didn't know was, like, a thing until recently. 
That was also, like, a big purchase that. And like, that ended up also, like, working out a lot. Saves me from, like, having to, like, make trips to the Laundromat and just spend, like, hours of my day, like, hanging out with the Laundromat. 
Also, you got one basically installed in your, like, apartment versus, like, having to, like, go down to the laundromat. 
Yeah, yeah. Like, it doesn't, like, hook up into the wall like a traditional. Oh, okay. You, like, hook it up to your, like, kitchen sink. 
Oh, okay. 
Smaller than, like, a regular laundry machine, but, yeah, like, big lifesaver. 
Yeah. Okay, interesting. I. I don't know if I've actually seen one before because, like, even the ones I've seen that you can buy, like, they're usually plugged into, like, the wall and there's like a tap or something. 
Yeah, like. Like water hookup. Yeah, yeah. No, this one just, like, has a hose and it, like. And it connects to your sink and it, like, drains the dirty water back into the sink. Yeah, it's. It's been really cool. I feel like years ago I saw. But I think they like, weren't as, like, you know, like, technologically advanced then, so I think they were, like, not very good. And I just, like, started looking into it Again, because, like, my laundromat here is kind of farther than, like, the last place that I lived and. Yeah. Yeah, it's been really cool. 
That's cool. Like, did you just, like, start researching and browsing it? Like, I. It's pretty cool because I. I'm, like, thinking how, you know, you would actually come across something like that. It's a good idea. 
Yeah. Well, I can't take full credit for. I live with my girlfriend, and she's a lot better at coming up with those kinds of ideas than me. I think that she just kind of, like, started, like, researching, like, alternatives for, like, you know, just, like, ways to, like, you know, do laundry easier, I think, and then that. Yeah, led down the rabbit hole of that. 
Yeah, for sure. That's. That's pretty. That's pretty cool. And, you know, you earlier mentioned, you know, when you were going on, like, Facebook Marketplace, and, like, sometimes you just. 
You. 
You'll buy things because, like, you know, it's not really high price. Like, it's okay. Like, it's much different than obviously buying something that's a. A few hundred dollars of investment. Like, did you ever notice if there was, like, a certain price for things that you were like, if it was under that price, you're like, you know what? It's okay. I'll just go get it. 
Like, like, if there's, like, under a certain price that, like, I'm, like, willing to be. Just to kind of, like, try it out, you mean? 
Yeah, like, a bit more experimental. Right? Because, you know, it could be, like, you know, anything under, like, $20, like, that's fine. Like, I'm willing to go for. 
For. 
Go for it. Some people, maybe it's a different number. 
But yeah, like, yeah, I think around, like, 20, like, dollars is probably, like, my number. If it's like, something smaller, like, you know, $15. Yeah, I think. I think that's, like. That's, like my number. 
Yeah. Yeah. Congratulations on moving in and finding a place and getting that all sorted as well, because I know that's a lot of effort. 
Yeah. Yeah, it is. It is, like, a whole thing. 
Ye. Now, can you, I guess, share with me maybe now, thinking back, like, the same kind of time period, what were some things you spent money on that you didn't really feel like was really worth it or maybe you regretted it a bit or, like, you just felt, like, very, like, kind of meh. Or like. 
Yeah. 
Not, like, didn't care too. Too much. 
Yeah, I think. I think, like, one that comes to mind is, like, a While back ago, at a. At like, a previous apartment, I had, like, bought a desk. And, . And it just, like, wasn't really like, what I was expecting. I was, like, lots of smaller than I was expecting. It, like, wasn't very sturdy. I feel like that's kind of like the struggle with, like, furniture. It's, like, hard to, like, tell the quality, you know, from, like, buying things online and, like, you know, like, envision it in your space. So. Yeah, like, that kind of thing also, I guess, like, some, like, just, like, generally, like, subscriptions. Yeah, Like. Like, like last year I like, got like, a, like, plant fitness membership. 
Not actually because I was, like, planning on, like, exercising, but because it was, like, really convenient for, like, when I'm, like, traveling and stuff to kind of, like, you know, have like, somewhere that, you know, I can like, utilize the, like, facilities, like, especially for, like, you know, if I'm, like, camping, you know, it's like, nice to have like, an actual, like, indoor show or, like, you know, somewhere where, like, you know, I can always, like, go in to, like, use the WI fi, you know, but. But I don't know. I didn't actually end up, like, using it all that much, so I feel like just, like. 
Like, not that there's, like, really anything, like, specifically wrong with it, but I feel like there's just, like, a lot of, like, subscription things that, like, I'll be like, oh, like, I think that this would be, like, a really good use for that. And then it just, like, doesn't really, like, fit into my life the way that I was, like, you know, that I was, like, envisioning. 
Yeah. And do you find yourself, like, having a harder time, like, remembering when you make those subscription purchases because they just kind of renew, like, on a regular basis? 
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Oh, I guess another thing recently that, like. I guess, like, wasn't exactly how I had been thinking is, like, well, I, like, really love my robot vacuum. It also, like, mops for you. And, like, I like. And I hate mopping. That's one of my, like, least favorite chores. So I was like, oh, this is great. Like, spent like, a few extra hundred dollars for the, like, mopping feature. And it, like, was not really what I thought. So that was kind of disappointing, that part specifically. But yeah. Yeah. Anyways, yeah, about, like, the subscriptions, like. Yeah, I do have, like. I do have a hard time, like, keeping track of those kinds of things. 
I feel like I, like, really tried to avoid subscription models as much as possible, like, for that reason, you know, like, I think a lot of things now, like, all, like, you know, do the free trial being like, okay, I'm only, like, going to use this, like, once or, like, you know, for a month. And then, like. And I've, like, kind of got into a habit of just, like, immediately, like, canceling the free trial, like, right after signing up for it, because I've, like, just, like, gotten myself in trouble so many times because I've, like, forgotten to. To, like, cancel it before the renewal date. Yeah. So I just try to kind of, like, avoid it as much as possible. 
Yeah, yeah, Makes sense. And you mentioned something earlier about, like, the mopping feature of the robot. Like, not quite what you expected. Like, could you, I guess, describe what you mean? Like, you thought it would do a better job, but it ended up, like, not really fulfilling that. 
Yeah, yeah. Like, I think, like, the vacuum is, like, super handy, but I feel like, mopping just kind of, like. I mean, I guess, like, just kind of like. I think what happens is just, like, the, like, robot itself is just, like, too small to, like, really be able to, like, actually, like, clean up any, like, messes that, like, need a mop, you know? Like, you kind of have to, like, scrub at things, you know? 
Yeah. 
And it just, like, it just, like, can't really do that. So that was kind of disappointing because I think it was, like. I think it was kind of, like, a lot of extra money for that feature. Like, I think, like, for one that was like, $800, when I, like, probably, like, could have gotten something that was, like, closer to, like, $250, like, without that. 
So. 
Yeah, that. That was kind of, like, a big disappointment. 
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. So basically, you still have to mop and you paid for this extra feature, though. 
Yeah, yeah. Just didn't really, like, didn't really, like, work out in real life how I, like, thought it would, I guess. 
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Awesome. Well, thanks for sharing. What we'll do now with the remaining 30 minutes, I will have you basically run, like, one or two, like, recent, like, statements through GPT with a specific prompt or instruction. I'm going to send you to run it. It's just going to, like, summarize and extract some information around spending patterns and things like that. Do you have one that you can access? 
Yeah, sure. Let me see. I kind of, like, spread my spending, like, across, like, a few different cards, but I can, like, use one that I use, like, the most. 
Yeah, that would be great. Let me send you the. I'll send you the instructions as well, okay. Okay. 
Yeah, let me just try to pull up like my most recent statement. It. Okay, so I see the prompt and then. Where should I put this into? 
Yeah, do you have a. Like, do you use Chat GPT or Claude or Gemini? 
Yeah, yeah. Just any of those. 
Yeah, any of those. And then like add the statement. It should be able to like. Yeah, run it. And then once that's. Once it's running, if you can like share your screen so we can like be on the same page, like, that would be great. 
Okay. I. I usually use like Microsoft Copilot. Does that work? 
We can try, yeah. 
Okay. Yeah, I also have like ChatGPT and Gemini, so I can like, do that too. 
Yeah, we can see the output works best with GPT, but I mean, it. It's easy to kind of steer it if you. If we need to. Okay. Okay. 
Yeah, let me put those in. Yeah, I can just do chatgpt then. Okay, so I like took like a recent statement and then. Yeah, let me just put that in it. 
Okay, got it. For this one, it seems like it's mostly like your, I guess, travel and home spend. 
Yeah, I kind of. I kind of like use a few different cards. Like, I have one that I use like, more for like dining and transit. Another one that I use. Yeah, I guess this is like more kind of like my online shopping cart. I have another one that's like more like dining and transit. And then another one that's like more kind of like entertainment and stuff like that. Another one for gas. So, yeah, they're kind of like split between like a bunch of different cards. 
Yeah, no worries. We can maybe start with this one and then like, if we need to look at the other ones for other categories, like, we can move on to that step. Yeah, so I guess like shopping was probably the. 
Let's see. 
See. 
Yeah, I like did a lot of like online shopping this month. I think this was like. I was like getting a lot of like stuff for the apartment. Like, I think like, these were like furniture. 
Got it. 
Me? Yeah, gotcha. 
Can you actually ask anything? Just say like, hey, could you put down the shopping transactions in chronological order? So interesting to see, you know, which ones were like the like one off like furniture stuff. And like, which ones would you say are like your more like regular restocking or like buying new clothes? Kind of, I guess, transactions. 
Yeah. This one was like jewelry. These two were furniture. I think these ones were clothes. I'm not remembering what this one is. This one was clothes. These two, I think were also furniture. This one. Furniture. Not remembering what this one or this one were. 
I was just looking up. Oh, Tanga has like, a bunch of deals. 
Okay. 
Got it, got it. 
Oh, I think this one was like. I think this one was like kitchenware. 
Oh, okay. Gotcha, Gotcha. So I guess if you had to like calc guess, like how. How much or guess or look at it, like how much of this was for your home moving versus, like, I guess buying stuff for, like, I guess other things. Like clothes. 
Yeah, I. I think that, like, just like, dollar amount, like, most of it was like home moving. I mean, just like, furniture is a lot more expensive. Yeah, I guess, like clothes, accessories, that kind of thing. Like, seems like somewhere like, you know, probably around like 100 to $200. And then like all the, like, you know, furniture stuff was like the like, really big stuff. So like, you know, over like a thousand dollars. 
Yeah, yeah, gotcha. And for your, like, I guess, clothes that you bought, do you remember, or clothes and jewelry. Jewelry. Do you remember what those were? 
Not specifically. I think this was like ear piercing, like, earrings. And then one of them was just like. Some of these are just like basics. Like, like underwear, like socks, that kind of thing. I think this one was shoes. Like sneakers. Yeah, I think that's pretty much it. 
Gotcha. Like, would you, I guess for the, like, clothes or clothes, accessories, like, shopping, like, would you consider those, like, I guess, like your staple items or like, more like necessities to kind of replace and buy or like, okay, it's a new season. You want shoes or were some of them, like, more like, I guess, like, nice to haves or just things that, you know, you got. But what you wouldn't necessarily consider essential. 
I guess I probably consider, like, nice to have, you know, just like, it's kind of nice, like, refresh every now and then. I also like, just traveling, like, lose clothes a lot. Yeah, I'm at like a hotel. But, you know, like, I like, you know, don't necessarily like, need more versus, like, you know, essentials. Like, probably more like groceries, that kind of thing. 
Okay, gotcha. Makes sense. And sorry, do you remember what the ebay one was? Or not really. 
Let me see. Oh, I think that ebay one was like a, like, power drill. 
Oh, okay. It sounds like it's like a. Another home. Home, I guess. 
Yeah, yeah. 
Got it, got it. Was there anything that, like, stood out to you or surprised you when you looked at this or. These are all things that you expected. 
I think, like, more or less expected. I kind of Thought that there would have been more. Honestly, this is like Black Friday time. So, like, I feel like I like, you know, really went in to like, you know, I'm like, oh, I just moved into this apartment. I should, like, take advantage of all the, like, deals and stuff. But I feel like. But I think like, overall is like, more or less what I expected. 
Yeah, gotcha. It's like, I guess you're like, oh, I thought I would actually spend even more, but actually it was pretty okay. 
Yeah. Yeah, got it. 
Well, are you. Do you have another, I guess, statement that has like. I think you mentioned it was like, dining and. Yeah. Do you have another one that's like other categories that you've mentioned as like, dining and transport, like, some of the more daily stuff? 
Yeah, let me like, pull that up. I feel like I don't really spend all that much on dining. I'm trying to see what would kind of be like a more balanced statement, I guess. Here's one. But I don't know why it's not. I guess I can like. I'll just do like two months. I feel like that would probably be a little better. I've been trying to, like, avoid eating out a ton. 
I mean, it's definitely a really good way to save money. 
Yeah. Let me see how to get my statement. Sorry. This is. It. Okay. I think this one. So do like the same prompt. 
Yes. 
Okay. Okay. 
So. 
Yeah, so this is like my dining from last month. There's not much on there. Like, that's like all the transactions I had for dining. 
You could probably ignore the. The AI stuff because it's just like, oh, you only spend on food. Which is. 
Right. Yeah. 
Yeah. Like, are most of these like eating out with friends or like your girlfriend? Or is it like. Some of it is like, okay. I picked up food for myself. 
I think kind of like a mix. Like, this was like out with friends. I think that. Like, this was like, actually like at work. We were like, traveling. We were in. Me and my girlfriend went to Nashville for work. So like, this one. This one, this one, like, I was traveling. Yeah, yeah. We like, ate out more while were traveling a little bit. This was like, I like, bought like food for like, co work for like, myself and co workers too. And I think like, these ones, I think two. There. There's another one that was like, with friends. I'm just not remembering which one. But I think that, like, these ones were more just kind of like grab and go type of thing. Maybe this one was like, more With a group of bowl. 
Got it. Yeah. So it seems like, I mean, most of it is like special occasion type of stuff. Like, okay, you're traveling and you don't have as much time to make your own food, so you go out. 
Yeah. 
But not like, oh, I take out like on a regular basis when I'm home. 
Yeah. Yeah. I've been kind of trying to like, cook at home more, that kind of thing. I have like another card for like groceries. So. Yeah, been just trying to like, limit my, like my like, eating out food. I feel like eating out gets like, so expensive so quickly now. 
No, for sure. Did you ever have a time like when you were like, in New York where like, you were maybe less conscientious as you are now about it and like. 
Yeah, definitely. I think the neighborhood that I lived in last there was just like a lot more food, just like easily accessible. I live a little bit farther out now. And so like, you know, even though there's like, still places close by, it's just kind of like, you know, I was just kind of like, okay, like now it's like, not nearly as easy. I should kind of like, you know, I've been trying to like, limit my food spending for a while and like, kind of like unsuccessfully doing it. Yeah. So, yeah, when I lived like somewhere that was like, even more walkable, I was just like all the time getting like, take out. 
Yeah. Gotcha. And did you have like a moment where like, you looked at maybe you're spending, you're like, oh, my gosh, like, this is kind of a lot more than I wanted it to be. 
I think that I don't so much like, consciously like, you know, like, budget and like, you know, like, look at my spending each month, but just kind of more of like a general idea of like, you know, like, of just like, you know, wanting to like, save where I can. 
Oh, got it. So it's more like a feeling of like. Okay, I can tell that I went a lot this week. 
Yeah, got it. 
No, that makes sense versus, like, okay, I like, consciously budget. I like, look at it and then make a decision. Like you can just feel it out a bit more. 
Yeah, yeah. It's definitely like more of kind of like a feel thing for me. 
Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay, in the remaining time, do you have time for maybe like one more area? 
Yeah, sure. 
Which other one do you see? Like, do you, I guess, spend more in like, entertainment or something else? 
I think like, groceries is like, probably like my biggest Expense now if that's. Yeah, let me see if I can find the statement for that. I don't know if it necessarily gives me like a like statement, but I guess I can like upload like the screenshots. Maybe it's there somewhere and I'm just like missing it. 
I think that also works. 
Okay, Let me see if I can like combine. Saying that I can only do like one like screenshot. Just try to like combine. Okay. Okay. 
Let me just says you're out, dude. Are you able to just copy the lines if there's not too many? 
Yeah, yeah, that. 
Because I think. Yeah, this seems there's probably a limit on the number of uploads, right? 
We. Do you need like dates or is just the like amounts. 
I think that's fine for now. Yeah. 
Okay. 
And this is all in like the last. 
Was it. 
Was it within a one month period? 
Oh, let me see. I think, I think from here. So actually let me just open it again. Okay. Or actually, let me see. Stays the 27th. So yeah, so I think within one month was here. 
Oh, okay. 
Yeah. 
Gotcha. And how do you. Yeah, it's gonna say zero for everything else. How do you, I guess, like pick which places that you buy groceries from? 
Just like a combination of things. Like what's like on the way, like what things they have available. I mean, that's kind of like the pro of like New York. Grocery shopping is like just. It's a lot easier to like, you know, kind of like get some things from some places. Like for example, like Whole Foods. I like, you know, we'll get like nicer like, you know, I'll get like me and like cheese. Things like matter more from like Whole Foods and like other things. It just is kind of like more based on like, you know, my route that day, what they had available. Grocery stores here have like pretty like small selections usually. So like, you know, sometimes we'll have to go to a few different places. 
Got it, got it. Yeah, this makes sense because I think you were also mentioning when were speaking earlier that like, it's very different from Texas where like, maybe you go like once every two weeks and get a bunch of stuff, but it's like wherever you happen to because like when you're New York, you're just up a like out and about and then you know the selection smaller so you buy fewer things to like bring back. So it seems that's kind of. It seems like it really is that case. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
How. 
How does it make it for, like, planning or is it, like, sometimes a bit harder and a bit more spontaneous? 
I think sometimes planning can be kind of difficult just because, like, you know, I have to remember, like, okay, I need to, like, you know, do I have everything I need? Like, I need to bring, like, grocery bags. If I'm going on a bigger trip, I need to remember to bring, like, I have, like, a cart for groceries. Like, just, like, a little, like, push cart and, like, you know, planning, like, what I'm gonna get and, like, you know, if it makes sense for me to go now versus, like, another time can, like, depend on, like, a lot of different factors, like the weather outside, how much I, like, need, you know, and, like, you know, if, like, something doesn't have what I need, like, that's, like, really annoying and kind of, like, will, like, throw off, like, my plan. 
Sometimes I'll even, like, if I'm getting something that is, like, less common or, like, you know, if I want, like, a specific brand of something, I'll, like, look online first. Like, I'll look on Instacart to see, like, what places have. Have that and then kind of, like. Kind of, like, plan my, like, whole, like, shopping, like, my grocery around that. So, yeah, it definitely takes, like, it. It definitely, like, sometimes takes a lot more. Like, a lot more thinking about. 
Yeah, no, for sure. 
But then I guess other times, like this, like, I think I probably just, like, I walked by CVS and was like, oh, I remembered I ran out of, like, whatever, like, today. Like, toilet paper. Like, I can just pop in and grab it. So like, other times it's like, you know, it can be, like, really easy and spontaneous in that way. 
Got it, Got it. Cool. Yeah, we're at the one hour. That's actually it. In terms of my questions, I want to just, like, thank you for your time and sharing for today. Really appreciate it. It's going to be very helpful. As for, like, next steps, I mean, what would be helpful is if you can send over, like, a PAYP account or email and then just get that sorted. But thank you. 
Okay, so I just, like, replied to the email thread that we have. 
Yes. 
Okay. Okay. Awesome. All right, Sounds good. Thank you. Have a good one. 
Sure. 
Bye. 
Bye.
