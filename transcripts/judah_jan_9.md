Hi, Judah. 
J
Judah Perry
00:03
Hello. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:04
Hi. 
J
Judah Perry
00:04
Nice to meet you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:08
How are you doing today? 
J
Judah Perry
00:09
I'm well, how are you? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:12
I'm doing well. 
J
Judah Perry
00:13
I'm doing well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:14
Where are you currently based? 
J
Judah Perry
00:16
In Dallas, Texas. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:18
Okay, nice. Very cool. Well, I can do a quick intro on my side, kick things off, tell you a little bit about what we're doing today, and then move over to just getting to know you through the call. So I'm Sherry and I'm doing research on behalf of Peak. We're a company that is looking to understand a little bit how young adults who are. Sorry, my cat is just a little cling. He's. He's a little clingy because he's a new kitten. So mind if. Don't mind if he's meowing a bit and jumping. He's a little bit. Yeah, it's got a bit of separation anxiety. Anyways, we're looking to understand a little bit more about how folks who are, you know, just a few years out of school are making adult decisions, especially around money. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:14
So this interview is going to cover two parts. One is we'll just have a series of questions to ask you to understand a little bit more about how you think about money, how you track it, things like that. And then the second part will go into a, a bit more of a interactive kind of experience where I'll have an app as well as a. A prompt. I'm going to have you run. Do you have ChatGPT or Gemini or. 
J
Judah Perry
01:41
Something that you use? Yes, I, I use Chatgpt the most. I have an account with them. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:48
Okay, great. So we can. I'll show you how to do it at that point. Any questions for me before we get started? 
J
Judah Perry
01:55
No. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:57
Okay, sounds good. All right, well, first question, just tell me a little bit more about yourself. What do you, I guess, how old are you? What do you currently do? What do you like to do for fun? Like anywhere that goes? 
J
Judah Perry
02:10
Yeah. Yes. So yes, I'm Judah, 25 years old and I work in human resources. So I'm an HR coordinator and I just started my job actually about coming up on three months ago, but I've been in human resources for. Thank you. I've been in human resources. Human resources for three years. I also have a master's in counseling. So by March I will also be doing part time counseling. So that of course will be another stream of income. And I plan on starting like content creation as well. And that'll be another stream of income for fun. I love. I am in the Dallas area. I feel like Dallas may be known for like food in a way. So I'm always trying like new restaurants and things like that. I love traveling. My favorite city to travel to Chicago. 
J
Judah Perry
03:04
And I also have a newfound passion for pickleball, so trying to get more active. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:09
Oh yeah, pickle is very fun. It's also, it's a grand equalizer because I enjoy playing tennis. But anyone who's like, oh, I play tennis regularly, they're just so good, right? And I'm like, oh, but pickles, like you can play with a lot of. 
J
Judah Perry
03:26
People, which I really like. I love it. Very cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:32
So you actually have like a couple of different income streams which feel very thought out. Like what was the thought process behind like you know, pursuing counseling and then doing content creation and all of that? 
J
Judah Perry
03:44
Yes, well, actually it was unin. Well outside of the content creation, the counseling and HR was unintentional. I had fully planned on going full time counseling when I had graduated with my masters, but that didn't work out. And why it didn't work out is because since I am a new grad and not fully licensed, I was considered an associate and so that would be me taking a pay cut at this time. And and also it's kind of difficult at least in this area to find a salary full time counseling job because there's like a lot of private practice which isn't typically salary. So I just like crazy stability when it comes to income and so keep my same like income and also have a salary. So that's why in content creation that's just more. 
J
Judah Perry
04:30
So I'm on TikTok a lot and I've been seeing a lot about this form of content creation called UGC that anyone can do to post it to your own socials. And I just thought that was interesting just to make like do that part time as well and just make some extra income maybe to cover car note and all that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:47
So yeah, gotcha. No, totally makes sense. So your plan is at some point to go into like counseling full time, but you have just a couple of steps in the meantime to get there. And of course like it's good to have money and stability to be able to like do things like travel and go try restaurants. 
J
Judah Perry
05:04
Exactly, yes. Yes. That's what I, I really want to be financially free in the sense where, yes, I can like travel and do things on my own time so build my own schedule basically. So yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:16
Yeah, makes a lot of sense. And are you from the Dallas area like originally or did you like grow up somewhere else. 
J
Judah Perry
05:25
I was born partially raised in a small town in North Carolina and then I moved to the Atlanta, Georgia area up until I was 22. Then at 22 I moved here to the Dallas area and have been here since and plan on staying. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:39
Oh, okay, gotcha. I see you really love Dallas, which is great. 
J
Judah Perry
05:45
I do, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:48
How was it like? I guess first moving? You just remind me you've been in Dallas since you graduated or you. 
J
Judah Perry
05:57
I've been in Dallas for three years and I finished my master's at a school out. I started my master's in Atlanta, Georgia area at Georgia State. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:05
Okay. 
J
Judah Perry
06:05
Then I transferred programs, master's programs and finished my masters at unt University of North Texas. And I've been in living in Dallas since May of 2022. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:17
Oh, okay. So it's okay? Yeah, it's been three years. What, what was it like transitioning to like a new city so that it's. 
J
Judah Perry
06:29
Like I was excited and ready to come here. However, I didn't realize how expensive moving is because up until that point I had always. I had been living with my parents and I had just graduated from my undergrad and so I really didn't have any money saved and I just like moved out here. And so it was like, it was exciting but also nerve wracking because as far as like money, I wasn't sure how I was going to make it because I of course to get approved for an apartment, what they asked for typically is like, you know, an offer letter. As soon as I got the offer letter for the job I had at the time to get to Dallas, I sent it to them and that was for a certain amount. 
J
Judah Perry
07:14
Turns out my second day at that job, I ended up getting a bump in my base salary, which was very helpful, but it was exciting. But seeing how I was going to stay independent financially was what was nerve wracking. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:28
Yeah, got it. I'm sure it's definitely a big change. What were some of the things that you did that you felt helped you take more control of the situation or it gave you a little bit more peace of mind? 
J
Judah Perry
07:45
I think exploring because didn't want to take out loans for grad school. So when I moved here in May of 2022. I didn't start my master's program at UNTil that August. And so in the meantime I was like researching what I could do. I was looking at maybe grad assistantships which didn't end up working out because I had a full time job that just wouldn't have worked out. I was researching, like, scholarships, maybe tuition breaks, even though I was considered out of state at that time, because I had to have been a resident for 12 months consecutively to be considered for. In state tuition. So was looking at all that. And that helped also. It helped that my. Both of my parents are Air Force veterans, and so my mom is what's considered 100% disabled through the VA. So that. 
J
Judah Perry
08:31
That meant for me that I was getting a stipend while in school. And I believe that's because I was, like, under the age of 26. Even though I wasn't considered a dependent, I was in the eyes of, like, the va, whatever. So, like, things like that helped me and then, like, trying to budget and trying to stick to it. But, yeah, eventually I did get used because also I didn't know what living by myself would look like. So when I first moved into my apartment, I would turn off the lights, like, be sitting in the dark, like, nothing like, things like that. Like, I don't know what the electricity bill will look like. But I started getting. Once I saw those bills rolling, I'm like, oh, this is dead. As I thought. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:13
Yeah, Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of new things that happen when. When you're living. When you're living on your own, it's. It's totally normal. I remember actually one of the, like, this is before autopay, but it was hard for me to remember to pay rent on time as embarrassing. It's like, okay, you got bills now as an adult. What when you said, like, you were, like, trying to, like, budget a little bit more. Can you, like, walk me through, like, how you thought about budgeting? Like, what that process was, what you thought you did well, what was a bit of a struggle. 
J
Judah Perry
09:50
Yes. So I knew that I spent the majority of my money on food because I do not like cooking and also don't like grocery shopping. So what that means is I'm always eating out. So it's like, in my mind, I knew what I spent the most money on, so I was trying to think of ways to cut back. I did that to an extent, and I did do good for a while, but now I'm back to, like, eating out a lot currently. And then also in my mind, I knew that I was spending a lot of money on furnishing my apartment, but I had to think, okay, do I want to do this? Furnish my apartment bit by bit, or go ahead and get it all out the way I wanted to go Ahead and get it all out the way. 
J
Judah Perry
10:29
I wanted my apartment, like a home. And so I knew I would have to, you know, save for furniture since I wanted to get that all out the way. But once I had my place furnished, I wasn't spending as much a month even considering how much I was eating out, because I was. Wasn't making those large furniture purchases. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:47
Yeah, yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
10:49
And so, yeah, things like that helped. What else? And honestly, like, since I was new to the area, I didn't have like a lot of social outings, so that just helped in itself. I didn't have any friends to go, like, go get food with. So I was eating out, but not like at like, you know, a steakhouse type thing. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:13
Okay, were you eating out? Like, like sometimes. Does it pick up? Did you eat alone out with some people out or. It was just a bit of a mix. 
J
Judah Perry
11:22
Pick up. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:23
Okay, got it. So you would, like, pick up and bring it home. Got it, got it. Makes sense. I'm sure. Like, you've obviously met friends now in Dallas and stuff. Like, do you guys go out to eat together now? 
J
Judah Perry
11:38
We do. Yes. And that. Yeah, we do. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:42
Got it, got it. And you mentioned that you did at one point, like, try like, trimming down, like, how much you were spending, like, eating out, like back then, I guess, especially like, as you're making all these purchases related to like, furnishing and like. 
J
Judah Perry
12:00
You know, the bills. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:02
What were you doing when you were trimming back? Like, what was the alternative? 
J
Judah Perry
12:06
Yes, so I was like, meal prepping and buying groceries more so to eat throughout the week and snack on to, like, deter me from eating out. And I still lay out, but not as much. Like, I gave myself, like, the weekend. So Saturday and Sunday to eat out during the week. I was like, purchasing groceries on Sundays to eat throughout the week and starting over like that. And so that did help a little bit. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:39
Got it. You said that you. You don't particularly like getting groceries or cooking as much. No. What about it is like, I guess, do you not enjoy as much? 
J
Judah Perry
12:52
It's because when, like, for example, if I'm buying groceries for the week, at the time I'm buying the groceries, I'm like, okay, I could eat this or on Wednesday by the time Wednesday comes around. Sometimes I have a taste for something different. And that's why I like eating out, because I can just go get what I have a taste for on demand. Where if I had, like, plan on eating tacos on Wednesday, now here comes Wednesday. I don't feel like eating tacos But I have to. So I don't like that. Like, I like having the freedom and I guess I could go and run out and like, for example, if I had more so a taste for salmon on Wednesday, I could go to the store, buy the salmon. 
J
Judah Perry
13:31
But then I'm going to be hungry while cooking and I just want my food now. That's why I don't like it. But I need to get back to. Yeah, cooking more. That's actually New Year's resolution. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:45
Yeah, got it. It's not always easy. Yeah. There's a little tip because I also struggle with this as well. My, my sin is I love food delivery, which is arguably even worse. 
J
Judah Perry
14:01
Yeah, I'm sorry, it is, it's. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:04
No, it's so much worse. I like, I think it's. It's like exploitation, like how much you pay for anyways. But one thing that has helped is I started to deliver my groceries. So if the day of I have a craving, I just, I actually use AI to like, give me the recipe and then I just order it and it comes and I'm like, that's actually helped me if. I don't know if this grocery delivery, but because I'm lazy and I'm like, I want it like right away anyways. That's something that I'm also trying. 
J
Judah Perry
14:39
Thank you. Yes. Because I know that's an option, but I've never explored. Like, I do drive up a lot. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:45
But yeah, better, because then you feel like. Because the. If you wake up in the morning, you can like go and click, click. Because yeah, I totally understand. If it's like at the end of the work day, you're like, oh, I. 
J
Judah Perry
14:58
Could go to the store, pick. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:59
It's like, I'm hungry now, you know, versus, oh, the food's already in my fridge, so I might as well just make it like. 
J
Judah Perry
15:07
It's true. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:08
Anyways, it's. It's pretty normal, so. So sounds like a lot of it comes down to, like, hey, I like to try new things and I also, like, don't like to. It's a bit of a hassle to kind of prepare food, but it is an area that you're looking to like, trim down a bit more, right? 
J
Judah Perry
15:30
Yes. And stay consistent with that and like, stick to it. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:35
Like, stick to a, like a routine for it. Yeah, got it. And then how do you, I guess, like, budget, like other areas that are like, I would say like, discretionary spend. Like, do you do much, like, shopping? 
J
Judah Perry
15:56
Yes. I used to do more shopping than I do now. I honestly don't know what changed, but I am the type of person. I don't do as much shopping now overall, but I am the type of person, if an event is coming up, like a birthday dinner or like just a regular dinner, like a rooftop dinner, I do feel the need to buy a new outfit for that. But I. I don't shop as much as I used to. And like I said, I don't know what has changed with that, but now I feel like I actually need to get rid of clothes, but for, like, spending money. Like I said, most of it goes to food. And outside of food, I don't shop for clothes, but beauty products. I feel like it's probably. And that includes makeup and skin care. 
J
Judah Perry
16:49
Not just makeup, but skin care. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:52
Yeah, yeah, got it. Yeah. Interest. A few things to unpack and ask more about. You said you used to like doing a lot more clothes shopping, but you don't know what changed. Do you at least have, like, a timeline of when that shift happened? Because it also could be related to, like, things happening in your life or. 
J
Judah Perry
17:17
Yes, I feel like that, like, over the summer, like, up until this summer or 2020, December 2025, I was shopping. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:29
A lot for clothes up until summer 2025. 
J
Judah Perry
17:33
So this is fairly recently. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:37
And when you said you used to shop a lot, like, what was the. 
J
Judah Perry
17:42
Like every weekend? 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:45
Okay. 
J
Judah Perry
17:46
I was, like, online. Both online and in store. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:50
Yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
17:51
Okay. Depending on what it is. For, like, tops and dresses, I don't mind buying things online, but for, like, jeans and bottoms, I do have to be in store because I have long. I have, like, long legs and I just have to make sure they're long, so. But. Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:08
Got it. Got it. And when, I guess when you were shopping, what was the. I guess, main driver? Was it like, hey, this is my weekend routine and I just want to shop? Or did you have things in mind or. 
J
Judah Perry
18:27
That's what it was. It was just, like, part of routine. I like to browse now sometimes. I did have things in mind, but for the majority of it, I do feel like that was just my thing, like going to the stores around here. Because that's another thing about Dallas. There's a lot of shopping centers. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:43
Yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
18:44
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:46
So basically, I guess in a way, it's like something to do. Yes. 
J
Judah Perry
18:51
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:53
And if you think about the things that you bought that you thought were not as worth it in retrospect, like, what were some of those items? 
J
Judah Perry
19:03
Mostly, like, tops. Like, I bought it and Sometimes I will try a top one, but sometimes I'm like, I can always return it, but then when it comes to actually returning it, I'm like, keep pushing it off until it's past, like, the 30 days or whatever, and then I'm just like, now I'm just stuck with this top that I don't really like when I tried it on. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:26
Yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
19:26
A lot of my regrets from clothes shopping were, like, tops. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:32
Got it. So it's like you. Was it, like, in the moment you thought it, like, what was going in your head? Like you thought it looked cute or you thought it was interesting, but then. 
J
Judah Perry
19:42
You felt like, need to get looked good on the hanger? Yeah, it looked cute on the hanger. And I'm like, in my mind, I'm like, at the top. It's hard to go wrong at the top, but sometimes just as it fits the way you think in your head. And so. But in the moment when first seeing it or first seeing items like that end up regretting, I'm like, oh, looks cute on the hanger. I just don't feel like trying it on. And. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:06
Yeah, yeah. And then it just. It sits, I guess, in the closet. 
J
Judah Perry
20:12
It does. And that's probably why I feel the need to get rid of a lot of clothes, because I haven't worn them and don't plan on wearing them. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:19
Yeah, got it. Got it. What are some things that you bought that you felt like, hey, that was worth it. Like, I'm glad, you know, I got it. I use it. 
J
Judah Perry
20:31
So this is more so going outside of clothes, but some of my makeup and, like, beauty products, like, for example, I have. What's the term for it? It's slipping my mind. But it's basically like. Basically like excessive hair growth for a woman. And so I like, bought like a facial trimmer thing, and I use that often. It does the job and it doesn't leave, like, any nicks or anything like that. So I love that product. And then I have, like, combo oily skin. And so, like, for makeup, I bought this Lauren Balm by Vanessa Myricks, and it works really well to keep my oil at bay unlike any other product ever. 
J
Judah Perry
21:15
And so, like, things like that have hold their value, even if they are a little bit on the more expensive side, but they hold their value and also last a long time. That's when I'm like, okay, I made the right decision by purchasing this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:30
Yeah. For the things that you bought that you felt like were a good decision. Right. Like, did you. Were you Intentionally looking for things like that for a while, or did they just, like, kind of show up while you were, like, browsing and looking around? 
J
Judah Perry
21:47
No, things like that that really have a huge impact. I typically am intentionally looking for them because I have, like, a need for them. Like, yeah, for, like, those examples I gave. What's another one? I'm trying to think of something outside of beauty and things like that. That's the only one. But yeah, things like that's typically. I'm typically like, yes, searching for them, doing research on the best ones to buy. Things like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:18
Yeah. And like, would you, like, would you be doing the research online or do you, like, talk to people in store to, like, you know, get their thoughts, try things on? 
J
Judah Perry
22:32
Not in store, just online research. I really don't trust asking people in. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:36
The store because they're just trying to sell you shit. 
J
Judah Perry
22:39
I feel like they're biased. Exactly. I'm like, of course you want me to buy the most expensive things. So I just do my TikTok research, my Reddit research, my AI research, all of that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:48
Yeah, that's. You know, honestly, these days there's so many ways to get your information. And I mean, I love Reddit because people generally don't have a reason to, like, make stuff up. 
J
Judah Perry
23:01
Right? No, there are those one also, they're trying to troll. And I'm like, you could tell though. You could tell being genuine. But that's why I love Reddit as well. And it's like, they always have answer. Someone has thought of this before you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:15
So, yeah, you're like, oh, thank God. Someone on the Internet, like, within the last, like, year has, like, put some thoughts together. You're like, okay, cool. Like, yes, I can roll with this. 
J
Judah Perry
23:26
Exactly. Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:28
Yeah. And I guess for the items that you also thought, like, were worth it, like, it feels like there's also this element of, like, it really works for you because some of these skincare products are so personalized. Like, you cannot wear what someone uses because, like, skin type lifestyle are all very different. It's quite hard to find one that matches. 
J
Judah Perry
23:48
Right. And that's why I have tried, like, for the oily skin thing, I have tried things in the past that people claim, multiple people claim, oh, this is for people, oily skin. And I'm like, well, I don't know who you're talking about, but it's not me. But with the blurring balm, it's like, okay, like, this actually does work for me, and it's not one of those things. I've been using that product for a while now because, you know, sometimes your skin can get used to something no longer as effective. No, it's in as well. So I'm a repeat product. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:23
Got it, Got it. I guess now with skin care, right, do you find yourself, like, sticking. Sticking to, like, the same stuff now that you're like, look, I found things that work for me, or do you have anything else that you're like, you know what I like, I just want. 
J
Judah Perry
24:37
To try new things. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:37
Or there's a new, I guess, thing I'm trying to solve for myself. 
J
Judah Perry
24:43
It depends on what it is. So for cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen, serums, which I guess is like pretty much my whole skincare, but I stick to the same thing because I'm afraid to try something to, like, have purging or just having bad reaction. That's not purging. But for things like makeup remover. What else? Like. Like a mist spray, because I use, like rose water mist. I'm open to trying other mist things like that. I'm open to trying other ones. Like, for example, right now, I'm still going to make a melting balm, and I'm open, and that's my elf. But I'm open to trying makeup melting balms because I feel like for that, for some reason in my mind, I'm less likely to have a reaction to things like that than if I were to just switch cleansers or moisturizer, sunscreen. 
J
Judah Perry
25:41
So I do have my staple products, but I also have products where I'm open to trying other things in skin care. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:49
Got it, Got it. So it sounds like, I mean, there's some things that are just foundational things like stainless steel staples, as you mentioned, where, like, you use it every day. So I guess making sure that it. Once you find something that works well, you kind of stick to it. When you try new things, is it usually like, I'm not super satisfied with what I have, or is it like, you know, I like to try new trends or maybe there's something new that's different that I think could add some novelty. 
J
Judah Perry
26:15
Yeah, it's the. Maybe there's something new that's different because sometimes I do feel like. Because like, for those things I mentioned, like the cleanser, the moisturizer, the sunscreen, that those were things where I went through a lot before I found one that worked for me. But for like the facial mist and the makeup melting balm, that's something I introduced that I didn't necessarily need, but that it's around because I like it. And so for those I'm like, I'm open to trying new things because there may be something that works even better for me that I don't know about yet because I haven't tried a lot of them yet. And then I'm I. For those items I can be influenced by like social media. 
J
Judah Perry
26:53
If a video were to pop up today on my Tick Tock talking about a makeup melting balm, people in the comments are also agreeing that it's great. Then I'll be like I need to go buy that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:04
So yeah, let me go look at and would you buy those things? Like would you buy those things online and then try it out and then see how it goes? 
J
Judah Perry
27:15
Or I would buy it online through Sephora, Ulta, Target or the brand website. Yeah, or like through the brand, the verified brand on Amazon. But I wouldn't buy like a one off from like a Tick Tock Shop. That is not because I think Tick Tock Shop does have verified brands. But like I don't know how to explain. I would just have to make sure that it's the actual brand because that's another thing when I'm doing research, I research of course the brand, that specific brand to make sure it's their product that's being talked about. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:51
Yeah, got it. So is there like, I guess with TikTok shop there's a little bit of a trust barrier that you have to worry about more so than buying from like an Ulta or like a. Yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
28:02
It'S just I've never. But the thing is I never personally bought from TikTok shop. I haven't yet. But I have known people who have and they've had good experiences with it. So the fact that I have like I know personally know people who have, I feel like my trust is increased a little bit more by that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:19
Okay, okay. So maybe it's like one of those things where like you could be down to do it but it's like just haven't come up yet. Yes, got it. No, that makes sense. Just reviewing my notes because I heard some follow up questions. Yeah, actually on the shopping stuff I think that covers most of it. Is there anything else that I guess either currently or like before like you were you know, spending money on that like you want to pay a little bit more extra attention to especially for things that are like quote unquote, not like necessary spends. 
J
Judah Perry
29:03
Right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:03
Like we can't really always control things like our utilities or like Gas or things like that. But there's things that we're like, oh, yeah. Like, that's totally, like, up to me to decide how much I spend here outside of food, outside of shopping. Like, is there another category or area for you? 
J
Judah Perry
29:21
I would say my subscriptions. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:25
Like digital subscriptions or gym. 
J
Judah Perry
29:29
Okay, digital, not gym. I don't have digital subscriptions. Like, my streaming services in my music apps. Music subscriptions, things like that. Which I guess that's awesome. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:45
Yeah, makes sense. And is it. And tell me more, like, what you want to pay attention more here? 
J
Judah Perry
29:55
Well, sometimes as I'm flipping through my TV and I'm seeing all these apps, I'm like, when's the last time I actually looked at something on that app? And I don't even know. Like, I'm like, I know I have a subscription. I don't even know because that's on. All those are on auto pay. I don't even know how much it costs. You know, like, maybe I should look into that because it doesn't seem like a lot if it's like $10, but things like that can be going towards my Chick Fil A, you know? So, yeah, I may need to look into that. And I haven't. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:27
If you have Disney plus, by the way, I'm just warning you, it is 20 bucks a month, and I just did not pay attention. I am guilty of this, by the way. So I actually tried a technique again. This is just a thought exercise. Actually, it's worked for me.  if I have a subscription where I'm not sure if I want to use or not, I cancel it. And then I just see if I you. If I miss the subscription and if I want to see a show on the platform, I will. Even after I cancel, I'll resubscribe, but then cancel right after. So that. Then you're basically only paying for the month. So I did that with Disney plus because again, 20 bucks a month, I'm like, it doesn't seem like a lot, but that's. It adds up. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:13
Especially if I also have, you know, Netflix and all of that. But after I resubscribed to Disney plus, I have been using it so much because, like, I'm aware because I'm like. 
J
Judah Perry
31:23
Oh, I have only a month to use this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:25
So, like, I just started using it every day and I'm like, now I'm like, oh, I'm getting my money's worth. 
J
Judah Perry
31:30
So maybe dollars does seem like a lot. I feel like that's high for. Is it not now I want to know how much is Hulu and Netflix. I'm like, is it $20, right? 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:37
No, no, it's. It's like they've been raising their prices. So, like, in the past, I swear, Netflix used to be like, less than $10 a month when I first started using it. So you're like, who cares? Now it's. You may want to check because there's also different plans they put you on, because now some of them have ads. So if you, like, accidentally were like, didn't look, and you're like, oh, I don't want ads. I think the subscription actually increases. So I totally get it. 
J
Judah Perry
32:06
Yeah, I need to, because I'm also not aware because since I was a student recently, I was under the student plan, but of course now that has expired. So it's like, I know I've had a student discount on that. Discount no longer applies. I don't know how much I'm paying. And like you said, there's different tiers, so that's something that I do have control over, but I just haven't gone around to. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:28
Yeah, no worries. And if you don't mind me asking, Right. You know this exists, but how come you haven't checked into it? 
J
Judah Perry
32:37
Because sometimes I'm like, I know I should, but sometimes I'm just like, procrastinator. I'm like, oh, I'm gonna get around to that. And then in my mind, I'm also like, well, my pockets aren't hurting enough. Like, if I was down to my last 200, of course I would be. Yeah. But since I'm not, thank God, I'm like, well, if I'm not really. If I'm not really noticing it for real, then I'm like, but to me, it's just smarter to take action. I just haven't. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:09
Yeah, got it. Got it. Would. Would you say that, like, generally describes maybe the way you're kind of approaching finances, where you're like, I'm not hurting terribly. So I don't check of these things as much as maybe I could be. 
J
Judah Perry
33:25
But. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:26
But if there was an easy way to do it, I know I could be a little bit better about it in these different areas. 
J
Judah Perry
33:32
Exactly. Because I just think about how, you know, some. Some platforms have, like, these hidden. Like, you can't get a clear answer. So I'm like, how much time will it take to see how much I'm actually paying? Is it actually going to be easy to cancel or not? I don't want to spend two hours, you know, going through this. So that's exactly what it is. I know I should, but I don't know how time consuming will because speaking of gym memberships, I don't have one, but that's just a good example. I forgot which gym it is. But people are like, they're notorious for being impossible to cancel your subscription. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:05
Yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
34:07
So things like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:09
Yeah, no, for sure. So it's almost like the uncertainty of how long it takes then that, like, prevents you from. And it's like a bit of a. It's a bit of a hassle. 
J
Judah Perry
34:18
Yes. Right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:19
Yeah, No, I totally get it.  one, I'll stop with the tips because I just really relate to some of these.  if you email. So I had this problem where I was paying for a newspaper, like Wall Street Journal, like, newspaper stuff back in the day. I don't really read the news as much because now I do more like, I read it more on, like, Twitter and other stuff. I was just tracking the emailing. Customer support is actually the best way to cancel. Like, because their sites make it really confusing and they have to respond to. 
J
Judah Perry
34:54
A cancellation request legally. Nice. Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:00
Yeah. They have to respond to you. 
J
Judah Perry
35:02
Right. There's a few of my, like, subscriptions. I'm like, I don't even. I haven't used that in years. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:06
So, yeah, like email. Email works. And there's like a legal trail as well. If you ask for request for a refund but they don't do it, that's not okay. 
J
Judah Perry
35:17
Right. Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:21
Got it. Okay, so we covered subscriptions, we covered shopping, covered food. I guess final, like, set of questions. Before I'll have you do an exercise, I want to understand, like, how you, I guess process wise, do tracking right now. Like, do you do this through, like, checking your banking app? Do you have Excel spreadsheet? Like, just do it in your head. You're like, you know what? Like, this seems okay. 
J
Judah Perry
35:52
So, yes, I do my banking app. I do have a spreadsheet and I actually have a notebook. It's like a budget notebook. Oh, okay. Those things are like my Excel spreadsheet, my budget notebook. I probably check those like, quarterly. Like this. I didn't checking. It's just, oh, I'm like, oh, maybe I should be tracking this. And that's when I go to them. But I'm not using those consistently. But. And then sometimes I use AI but for one off stuff. So the majority of the time I am using my baking app and just seeing. Yeah. Because I'm also, for some reason lately I've been like, nervous around like my in for my card info being stolen like at a gas station or something. I don't know. So I've been my account a lot more. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:47
Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, so for this next part I'm going to ask do you have like a bank statement, like a PDF of your last like credit card statement? 
J
Judah Perry
37:01
PDF? No, I doesn't have it. Let me see, let me try to get one of a credit card, a debit card, whatever you spend. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:15
Do you have one that you like do most of your spending on? 
J
Judah Perry
37:18
I do. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:21
Okay, what I'm going to have you. So we're going to just walk through a couple like I guess recent transactions that you made. I'm going to just ask you some questions about how you feel about them. Again, like none of this goes out. I will not keep your data or any of that. Actually how we'll do this is once you have the PDF I'm just going to send you a prompt. It's a very simple prompt. Just pasted it here. It's just. It's just kind of consolidating the statement. So again if it's a statement is like line by line transactions, hard to read. This just kind of groups things a. 
J
Judah Perry
38:04
Little bit more easily. Okay, let me see. I'm in one of my accounts. I've never done a PD. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:12
It doesn't have to be a PDF. I think anything that ChatGPT can read, I think images can be fine too. I've actually like straight up copy and pasted like the text of it and it also works. 
J
Judah Perry
38:25
Yeah, that's what going to do. Oh, still here. So does it matter over the past few days, over the past week, past. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:43
Months is good if you. 
J
Judah Perry
38:55
And of course this is a little like different because I also forced the holidays. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:03
That's okay. Yeah, I think that's okay. 
J
Judah Perry
39:09
Yeah. And go ahead and paste all this into chat GPT. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:14
So basically separate out the prompt at the top and then you can add the transactions as below into ChatGPT. It should be able to run it. 
J
Judah Perry
39:26
Oh, okay, I see it now. Chat. Okay, I'm sorry, my copy and paste is off because my work laptop has a different copy paste command than my personal one. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:08
Yeah, I know, it's all good. 
J
Judah Perry
40:11
Okay, so separate these out. It. All right. And then just share my screen. Okay. Share my screen. Okay. Can you see this? 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:35
Yes. Maybe scroll up. I'm gonna just make sure the prompt is pasted in. Okay. I think it's just running. Maybe take a look down and see. 
J
Judah Perry
41:58
If it's oh, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:01
Cool. All right. Yeah, I'll just like have you scroll through and like react to it. But this is something that is also kind of helpful to just see a quick breakdown. 
J
Judah Perry
42:24
Almost like this makes sense. I feel like my shopping. I don't know. I feel like this makes sense. But then some are off because of the holiday season. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:37
Yeah, no, totally. I mean, shopping will be. 
J
Judah Perry
42:41
Oh my gosh, my subscriptions. And do you see the grocery spin versus the dining? So funny. Oh, my gosh. All right. Well, I spend more in certain areas than I thought. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:00
What was surprising for you as you're going through. 
J
Judah Perry
43:04
Yeah, what's surprising are my subscriptions. I'm like, how many do I have? I feel like I have four. Four. And if that's a hundred dollars, that's averaging 25. I'm like, that isn't. That's a lot. I may have more than four, though. And then trans. Yeah. Is transport considered gas? I guess. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:29
I think gas should be picked up here. Gas and then like ride share. Like, okay. Public transit of Dallas has it maybe not as much. 
J
Judah Perry
43:39
Yes, my utility. That makes sense. My shopping is just a little bit off. That's probably how much I used to spend just myself, but I don't feel like I spend nearly that much. I think it's a little bit off because of Christmas, The dining and the groceries. The like, the range. That's just so funny to me. I'm like, wow. But yeah, what's surprising to me is how the most surprising thing is the subscription cost. Top 10 largest single. Okay. I feel like this top 10 largest single transactions would more so be changing month to month. Some of them will be the same, like my apartment, my insurance, my church, my phone bill, my Internet will be the setting. But I'm surprised that. Oh, single transactions. Okay, that makes sense. All right. And then. Oh my gosh, this is actually embarrassing. The pickup. Food takeaway. 
J
Judah Perry
45:20
That's so funny. 23 transactions. Wow. Dining. Oh, so actually it's more because dining and restaurants and pick up food. Takeaway. That's all. So that's a total of 35. There's only 31 days in December. That's so funny. Shopping makes sense. I feel like my beauty transactions are more so services rather than purchases. Like laser hair threading. I think it'll be interesting to see, like, I don't know if that'll be grouped in here like Sephora Ultra purchases. Oh, the transport is the toll roads. Oh, wow. My guess, the subscriptions. See how I wonder how much Netflix is. That's interesting. And then utilities bills that really can't change. Only made one. Groceries only made one. Grocery purchase. Key takeaways. I'm not surprised by this. Wow. I think this is interesting though how we discussed this already. Food is our most frequent and then subscriptions need reviewing. 
J
Judah Perry
47:03
It's like I already knew that but this will probably motivate me more so to actually do. And I could easily identify cutting $300. $300. That's so funny. This was very interesting. I like this. It's like I've used chat GBT for one offs but I've never used it in this way. I never would have thought to use it in this way. But this is very helpful. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:36
You can keep the prompt and use it whenever. Whenever you need to. 
J
Judah Perry
47:40
Yes. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:42
You can also ask questions, right? Like there's areas like what are my subscriptions like, you know. Yes. Because I think you said you thought you had four, but I think the list is eight. So you could dig into that. See, I mean GPT could probably recommend you where you could cut as well. I'm not sure what they're going to say, but they could probably come up with something. 
J
Judah Perry
48:07
Right? Wow, that is so funny. A monthly budget target, huh? It's like I do want to budget better moving forward. I just don't know where to start. Like I wouldn't. I wouldn't even know a target. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:31
Yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
48:32
And then considering that I'm about to have another stream of income, I don't know. I don't know if I that means I should up my budget or should I just focus on saving? I don't know. Yeah, that's very interesting. Let's see. Can you scroll up again? Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:08
Okay. Okay, got it. Sorry. If you go down to the restaurants rest. 
J
Judah Perry
49:19
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:20
Okay. So for these. Okay. 
J
Judah Perry
49:22
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:24
So seems like for food it's mostly like fat fast food. Like I guess pick up fast food. No need to feel embarrassed or anything. And I guess not so much coffee. Right. Like some people have a Starbucks habit. 
J
Judah Perry
49:41
But I am not a coffee person. I think that Starbucks run, if I remember was a brownie. Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:52
If you look at like I guess these two. So pick up food and dining. Would you say that last month was somewhat typical or would you have maybe spent a little bit more because it. 
J
Judah Perry
50:01
Was the holidays, it was typical. Now I will say this restaurant is new, but I loved it so much that I will be going back. But this was a birthday dinner. But I feel like even without the birthday dinner, I probably still would have gone to, like, a steakhouse. Texas roadhouse. Their lemon pepper salmon is my guilty pleasure. So I do eat that a lot monthly. And Genia ramen, to me, it's ramen season, so that probably will be here for the winter season. Maybe not as much as ramen, but the total spin to me isn't surprising. For that, I feel like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:43
Got it. And when you look at that number, like, you feel pretty okay with it. You're like, okay. Like, on the weekends, it's my thing. I like going out and eating like that's protected. 
J
Judah Perry
50:53
Well, that's the thing. This is more than just weekends. I feel like I could cut back on that number. But see that number, I'm not like, oh, my gosh, I need to cut back now. It's like, I could. If I do, I honestly, this makes it easier to see, so it gives me a little bit more motivation to actually cut back. But I just don't know if that's even realistic. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:19
Yeah, is. I guess, like, is part of the feeling around budgeting. Like, you're not sure what a good number is, and therefore it's hard to know how everything kind of adds up. 
J
Judah Perry
51:30
Yes. It's like I don't have a target. Like, I do want to be saving for a home. Fun and things like that, but I'm like, that just takes like. I don't know. I would even know, like, a number to start with. But as far as cutting back, I feel like. I feel like it will be more realistic if I don't go from, you know, eating out six, seven days a week to eating out two. I feel like I just need to go, you know, five and then four and then go from there. Yeah. But I still wouldn't know what that will look like on a monthly basis to know I'm hitting my target. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:17
Yeah. Got it. Do you. Have you spent time thinking about, like, the kind of home or how much you'll need for it? 
J
Judah Perry
52:29
I actually have recently, because in Texas, the property taxes are really high. So I was actually thinking about property taxes, and I was like, huh, how much would that add to the mortgage? So I have thought a little bit about that in the homes in my area that I like, they're. They're like, extensive. And so I've been thinking about that as well. Like, for my first home, would it even be realistic to stay in the area? The city I'm in right now would have to move a little ways out to get like a. Still a nice home, but just in an area that's like has a lower cost of living. So. Yes. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:13
Got it. I was actually saying we could. You could try it here as well. There's a. 
J
Judah Perry
53:22
Let's see. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:28
Do you know how many years you would be looking to buy and what the typical down payment would be? 
J
Judah Perry
53:37
When you say years, you mean how many years from now? 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:40
Yes, yes. Like, is it like in five years, three years, seven years? 
J
Judah Perry
53:44
Yes, hopefully within the next three years. And then. So typically the homes, I like a buy area. I feel like they. Speaking of newspaper, you're talking about newspaper subscription. I get the newspaper for my city and they have a section. I don't know, I don't see it. They have a section that says the average home price per zip code or by zip code. And I think that the average home price is like 800,000 for my zip code. But the cities that are like, close but more affordable, I don't know their average home price, but I have seen homes in those areas for like 400,000. And from my understanding, I think people suggest putting on 20%. Let me see, what's that number? 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:36
I think 20% sounds about. It's usually like 20 to 25%, I think, depending on where you live. 
J
Judah Perry
54:43
So that's 80,000. So that, I guess would be a good target. 20% of 400,000 is 80,000. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:52
All right, so what you can try here is say, hey, I'm looking to buy a house and I need to save 80,000 in three years. 
J
Judah Perry
55:04
Right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:06
For the down payment, how much would I need to be saving. 
J
Judah Perry
55:12
Each month? 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:15
And what you can basically back into is like, how much you're saving now, how much you need to save each month, and then you can see what the difference is. 
J
Judah Perry
55:23
Okay. Okay. See, this number is doable because my second stream of income will probably be a little more than that. And then on top of what I'm already saving, that's doable. Show how much less you need if you earn interest. I will be earning interest because I save in a high yield savings. I just don't know that number. I want to enter this prompt because I'm like my current spinning. I don't know what it would say. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:24
Yeah, I mean, you can see if it provides suggestions around basically where you could potentially like, save more to, like, more confidently reach the number. 
J
Judah Perry
56:36
Okay. Yeah, it's probably, Wow, this piece is realistic to cut it by 40%, actually. Yeah, it says still eating out just for intention. Oh, Only keep one or two subscriptions. No budget for hair laser beauty. 150 per month. That is not going to be enough for my hair Laser leave as is. Okay, well, if I were to do that, then that definitely is realistic. The monthly cat. Now that's what's scary. A cat. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:54
Yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
57:55
I'm like, no, I can try. I guess this is adulting. Help you reduce food spending without feeling restricted. Well, yeah, I just wouldn't want to go restrict. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:21
I think the boarding cap is probably the. Oh, yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
58:28
And then. Oh, I am getting a. I'm coming up on three months at my job and I have a salary review, so I will be getting a base salary bump. Well, actually, this has been very helpful because I was thinking about my mind not too long ago and now I do have a number in mind, which is a step of that to me, that's a huge step, having a number in mind. I just need to mentally prepare myself to actually budget. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:08
Yeah. Hopefully this exercise was somewhat interesting or helpful. What would you say was your biggest realization when going through it? 
J
Judah Perry
59:25
Biggest realization is just. Yeah. How much I do spend. Like I said, it wasn't surprising, but it's like, wow. Seeing a. Like a total number just hits a little bit differently. Especially since it was two categories that were basically the same thing. Just food. And then seeing that as compared to groceries and how long we had one grocery transaction. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:55
Yeah. And do you find that it hits different than like when you look at your banking app and you'll see like the individual transactions come through, but it's different than seeing the total.

Yes, it's different. Seeing the total versus individual transactions. But that this also goes to show. Show that things like $15, $10 can add up. Because in my mind I'm like, oh, it's only $10, but that's for a single transaction. So it's helpful to see like a total per ca.

For like fast food. Right. Like, I think there's 23 of them, if I'm not wrong. Were most of those Chick fil A or do you kind of mix? 
J
Judah Perry
01:00:53
Most of them probably were chickfila. Okay. I. Yes, most Chick fil a. Chick fil A. There's four chick fil A's in all directions of me within 10 minutes. So that's just very convenient. Like during my lunch break, I work remotely. During my lunch break, I just run out grab to play. That's actually what I did today. So that was one of the transactions. And it's. And then I get Chick fil A points. I like the rewards program. I vary what I eat. I get a chicken nugget, a sandwich, a salad. So, yes, Chick Fil A will be hard to cut back on, and that's something. That's a habit that developed when I was in grad school. School. So it's been ongoing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:01:40
Yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
01:01:41
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:01:43
And does seeing this make you want to, like, change anything about it or you're like, it's going to be so hard. Like, I'm g to. I want to find another way to maybe get to my goal through something else. 
J
Judah Perry
01:01:58
You know, I need to change it. It's like, it makes me, like, in my mind, think I do need to change it, but I just want to see if my actions actually reflect that mental. Mental note of, oh, I need to change this. Yeah, yeah. I just. Like I said, I just feel like cutting back to me. I just need to make small steps to cut back. I can't. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:02:27
Yeah. 
J
Judah Perry
01:02:27
Like, I can only go to chick two times a week. That's not realistic. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:02:32
So, yeah, for sure. And sometimes it helps to, like, substitute. I mean, I know some people. I mean, again, this is just a small thing, but if people have something that they really love eating out, they find a way to make it at home in some way, and they're like, okay, I got my. I got my fix. I got my pasta fix. I got my fried chicken fix. 
J
Judah Perry
01:02:55
Right. Yeah. Yeah. I need to consider that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:03:01
Yeah. Well, thank you so much for your time, Judah. This is really helpful. We are basically just, like, trying to understand how people think about money. I know traditional budgeting is very hard to do. People do not like to be told that they're getting less of something. And so, to me, it's all about reframing. It's like, how do you get the same in life that you enjoy? You should not take those things away from you, but do it in a way that sets you up for the version of the future. In the future of Judah owning this house. Right. Like, you want to make sure that both Judas are happy. Right. Current Judah who gets to have chicken, and then future Judah who gets to own a home. 
J
Judah Perry
01:03:45
Yes. Right. Where she eats Chick Fil A. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:03:48
Yes. 
J
Judah Perry
01:03:50
But, yeah, I think that's very important to keep, like, to have that in mind. Like, yes, people have savings goals, but they also don't want to feel like their. Their lifestyle is changing too much or that they're. It's hard, like, restricted, like the chatgpt said. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:04:09
Yeah. Well, thank you so much for your time and being so, like, open and honest. Really appreciate it. 
J
Judah Perry
01:04:18
