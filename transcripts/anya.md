Anya Sorensen: 00:00 
 Hi. How are you?

Sherry Jiang: 00:05 
 I'm good, I'm good.

Anya Sorensen: 00:08 
 Hope you're having a good day so far. Where are you based out of? I live in California.

Sherry Jiang: 00:16 
 Oh, nice.

Anya Sorensen: 00:17 
 Which part? Los Angeles.

Sherry Jiang: 00:20 
 Okay, cool. I'm from the Bay Area.

Anya Sorensen: 00:24 
 Oh, cool. Yeah, Very nice.

Sherry Jiang: 00:28 
 And have you been in LA for a long time or moved there?

Anya Sorensen: 00:33 
 No, I moved here in September, so it hasn't been long at all.

Sherry Jiang: 00:38 
 Oh, wow. Okay. So that's like six, I guess, like five or six months or so.

Anya Sorensen: 00:44 
 Yeah. How are you? Good.

Sherry Jiang: 00:49 
 How are you liking it so far? Good.

Anya Sorensen: 00:53 
 I used to live in D.C. before moving here, and people are just so much happier here and the weather is better, so both very good things.

Sherry Jiang: 01:04 
 Yeah. Maybe it's the. The sun and the vitamin D. Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 01:11 
 And like, the, like, distance from politics, too, I think.

Sherry Jiang: 01:14 
 Oh, yeah. Are you from the D.C. area, like, originally, or you just, like, were there right before and I was there for work?

Anya Sorensen: 01:25 
 I grew up mostly in South Florida, but my family's French, so. Okay. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 01:32 
 Oh, okay. So your. Your family, like, your. Your parents, like, they grew up in France, and then you were like, you just grew up in the States?

Anya Sorensen: 01:43 
 Yeah, I grew up mostly in the States, but we spent, like, a lot of time when I was younger back in France. But yeah. So, like, I grew up mostly in Florida, but I don't have any family left, so it's like. I don't really say I'm from Florida. Yeah. But yeah, are you? I guess. Did you live your whole life in the Bay Area?

Sherry Jiang: 02:07 
 I also lived around different places, so I. I went to school in San Diego for a while as well. Um, so I do love Southern California. When people ask, like, do you like NorCal or SoCal? I'm like, well, I don't know if I have to choose. Like, there's good goods to both. And then I also lived in the Midwest in, like, a small town outside of Chicago, but similar to you with Florida. Like, I don't have any, like, family that lives there. All my friends that were in Chicago don't live there anymore. They live in, like, New York or, like, Austin, Texas. Like, they just don't live in Chicago. So I haven't really. I haven't really been back in more than 10 years, I think. But it's okay. I mean, it was nice to grow up there.

Anya Sorensen: 02:58 
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 03:02 
 Yeah. Well, thank you so.

Anya Sorensen: 03:04 
 Oh, sorry. I just had a quick question. I guess, like, before we got too much, like, into it on user interviews, it still shows that, like, I haven't scheduled. Are you able to Add like this time in for me. Oh yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 03:22 
 I think I should be able to. So basically, user interview. Let me just make a note to myself before I forget. Just one second. Give me one sec. I just don't. I want to make sure I remember to do this.

Anya Sorensen: 03:42 
 So.

Sherry Jiang: 03:43 
 So user interview has this like bug right now where for some reason when, when I don't directly reschedule like a time they have and I try to like unschedule and schedule again. If we already like filled our initial set of schedules up to a point where like, oh, let's say we had like 10 interviews we want to do, but we did 10 initial sketches, schedules the corrections don't get. We're not able to do it on the platform properly. So I'm going to double check to make sure if that's. Oh, you know, the team. If that's not possible, we can also provide the compensation another way. Just so you know. So I'll make sure that happens. But that's the, that's the gist of it. Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 04:30 
 Okay. Thank you.

Sherry Jiang: 04:32 
 Yeah, no problem. So, yeah, happy. I'll just do like a quick intro on my side and what we'll be covering and just want to spend most of the time getting to know you a bit more. So I'm Sheri and I'm doing research for a company called Peak. We're really curious to understand how I guess this next generation of folks who are just graduating college are making decisions in early adulthood, especially around money and hopefully building a product that is more empathetic to those experiences versus ones that.

Anya Sorensen: 05:07 
 May be built for folks who are.

Sherry Jiang: 05:09 
 Like in their 30s and 40s.

Anya Sorensen: 05:10 
 Right. Which is very different.

Sherry Jiang: 05:13 
 During the course of this interview, there'll be two parts to it. One part will be a series of questions just to get to know you, how you make decisions around money, how you kind of, you know, what's been working, what's not. And then the second part of it will be going over a few different prototypes or like apps. They're not necessarily like production apps, but they're more like test apps that we created just to get a bit more of your feedback.

Anya Sorensen: 05:43 
 Any.

Sherry Jiang: 05:43 
 Any questions before we, before we get into things?

Anya Sorensen: 05:48 
 No, that sounds good. Awesome.

Sherry Jiang: 05:50 
 Well, I already. So normally the first question is just to ask you to tell me a bit more about yourself. I. We went into some of it already but would love to hear a little bit more around I guess.

Anya Sorensen: 06:04 
 Like how.

Sherry Jiang: 06:05 
 What you are up to right now, like profession wise, for fun, like when you graduated university and like how old you are so some of those basic things and we can get into there.

Anya Sorensen: 06:20 
 Yeah. So I graduated in 2022 and I graduated from Dartmouth in 2022 and now I am a first year PhD student at UCLA. Between that I worked in consulting, first for like a bigger company in New York and then for a smaller company in D.C. i was a government major and now I'm like a political science PhD student. A continuation there. But yeah. Does that answer?

Sherry Jiang: 06:56 
 Yeah, well, I'm, I'm kind of, I'm kind of curious. You also said, like, you moved away to get away from D.C. what, you're, you're, you're still also doing political science.

Anya Sorensen: 07:06 
 I'm like, kind of curious.

Sherry Jiang: 07:07 
 Like what? Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 07:11 
 So I was a contractor and like with the government, like for a firm who contract the government. And I'm interested in political science, but I'm interested in international relations, specifically like international violence. So not American politics by any means. Okay. So getting away from like the politics in terms of like working in that space, but I'm still interested in like political science, but less like governance and more, more conflict resolution.

Sherry Jiang: 07:53 
 Got it, got it. And sorry. Okay. Yeah. Just so you know, there's like a tiny little bit of lag because of network. So if I've ever like asked, like clarify or asking, it's because I just want to make sure I heard the end of your sentence. But that's, that's really cool. So what, I guess you just got started with your PhD program, right? In September. I'm guessing that's what you moved for. How's that been going so far? Like being back in school. So first.

Anya Sorensen: 08:29 
 It'S definitely been nice to be back in school. It kind of made me realize like, how my job, which is why I think it went so well. But like, I didn't necessarily enjoy like the subject matter of my job. So it's nice doing something I enjoy. But it's definitely been, been a big transition, like me wise because I made a lot more money working obviously than I do now. So that's been like a big change. For sure.

Sherry Jiang: 09:02 
 Yeah. How? I guess, like, if you think about like, what were the, I guess major changes recently, Right. As you went from like, you know, working in like a salary job and then moving into like the program. Like, what were some of the biggest things that were, I guess challenging during that transition?

Anya Sorensen: 09:24 
 I think like, definitely relearning finances and like budgeting. Because when I was working, I would get my paycheck. Well, I, when I started working, I got a biweekly Paycheck or like every day. Then it transitioned once a month. So that was already a change there. But now it's basically like, I pay myself, so I get like a. I get a check every quarter because we're on a quarter system and I have to, like, budget that and pay myself out throughout for that. So I would say, like, that part has kind of been the biggest adjustment because it's a lot more, like, it's a lot more planning than I'm used to in terms of. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 10:26 
 Got it. So basically you get a. Do you get like a stipend for like an entire. I think is. You see, still on the quarter system, even for the graduates program? Okay. Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 10:37 
 Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 10:38 
 So you get basically a stipend at the beginning of the quarter and then you have to, like, manage it throughout yourself.

Anya Sorensen: 10:46 
 Yeah, like, it's like a fully. I have to manage it myself. Like, I have to save a portion. I have to save a portion. And then like, other spending and like last year in particular, so they recommend typically that. And I think you really have to like, file quarterly taxes if you're making money but not paying taxes on them. Right?

Sherry Jiang: 11:13 
 Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 11:15 
 But last year, since I worked the majority of the year, I was like, I had a W2 for like, more than one or two quarters. So I. I wasn't required to do that yet. So just. Yeah, been a big, I would say, like, financial transition because then this year I'll have to file quarterly taxes. So saving enough money through those taxes from that stipend and all of.

Sherry Jiang: 11:50 
 Yeah, no, I'm sure it's not easy. And I think, yeah, quarterly budgeting definitely sounds like an exercise in like, self discipline as well versus, like bi weekly where you can kind of like, you know, manage those chunks. What would you say were, like, has been like, some of the lifestyle changes that you had to make? I'm not sure about cost of living between DC and LA but I know California in general is what is considered expensive. Right. For folks that move there, obviously there's some things that we could buy or do that we can't do as easily anymore when we, like, transition jobs. Like, what were some of the things that you had to, like, make in terms of like, lifestyle changes?

Anya Sorensen: 12:37 
 Yeah. So I think, like, the biggest thing would be rent. In D.C. i own a bedroom apartment, whereas here I live in, like, UCLA owns these, like, graduate student apartments where it's like a dorm. It's an apartment and I got assigned to one with a roommate. And obviously, like, the rent living here is subsidized. Especially with a roommate. So I'd say like that has been the biggest change because like my rent in DC was like 1800 for a similar apartment would easily be like $3000 here, if not more. Yeah, so that's probably been the biggest change. Gas prices too are significantly higher. So I think it's like a lot of it is like adjusting unnecessary, like consumption down.

Sherry Jiang: 13:36 
 Okay.

Anya Sorensen: 13:36 
 Things that like I used to be able to afford, like without thinking twice about it, like now I have to think a little bit more about it. Sorry I said so times like at the end, but I had nothing else to say.

Sherry Jiang: 13:58 
 Oh yeah, no worries. I think it's just the lag, but it's totally fine. When you said you had to adjust some things like down, are you saying these are the assumptions for your like necessary spends or your like nice to have spends? I was just trying to make sure I got that correctly.

Anya Sorensen: 14:16 
 I would say both a combination of necessary spends and suspense. Like for example, before I wouldn't really think twice about like what I would buy grocery wise, right? Like if I wanted raspberries and they were, you know, seven dollars or something, I would just purchase the seven dollar raspberries and think twice about it because like it was food, it was a food item, a necessity, you know. Whereas now like I try to like try to do more price comparisons and knowing that raspberry should be like what, $3, maybe $4 if I see that they're seven, I would like not get them. So stuff like that, it's like necessary items. I definitely try to like cut consumption and then for like nice to have, I've definitely cut my consumption a lot. And I would say that's also because like my boyfriend still lives in D.C. and honestly like doing things together, major source of spending. And we can't do that as often obviously. So that has easy to cut down on spending on like fun things.

Sherry Jiang: 15:40 
 Yeah, gotcha. What about for things like like, I don't know, shopping or like buying things or would you say like most of the, I guess fun or nice to have spending that you used to do was more like experiences with like your boyfriend or friends.

Anya Sorensen: 16:01 
 I would say there were more experiences. But on like I did try to cut down spending like shopping like at the start of last year, start of 2024, just because I was thinking about going to grad school and I was like, I'm gonna have to move everything I own, right, if I don't go to see. So I think I got into a better habit of not buying, not shopping too Much because I was definitely shopping a lot before then and then now I would say, like, I definitely, I have significantly also less space and less of a budget. So I try to blame the space space and think about where I would put these things that I might want to buy. If I can't like, think of that super easily if I don't need it, like, that can help encourage me not to buy it.

Sherry Jiang: 17:06 
 Yeah, got it.

Anya Sorensen: 17:11 
 When you.

Sherry Jiang: 17:12 
 So let's talk more about like experiences. Right. So what were some of the things that you liked to spend money on that you enjoyed that were in that kind of realm?

Anya Sorensen: 17:24 
 Yeah, so probably things like going out to restaurants, going out bars, going out to like mini golf movies. And I would say like one thing about California that has also adjusted that is that like in dc, better transportation than in la, so it's easier to and like cheaper to go get a drink at a bar for happy hour because you don't have to think about how you're going to get there. Whereas here it adds that extra layer. Which do you think makes not spending a little bit easier? Because if I have to pay a $20 Uber each way to get one drink, like, it's just not really worth it.

Sherry Jiang: 18:20 
 Yeah. And how does that change, like make you feel?

Anya Sorensen: 18:29 
 I would say, like sad, but at the same time my boyfriend does come like once a month, once every like other months. So then we do all those like comes. So it's like I still feel like I'm doing them. And I think like, if, if it weren't for that, I would probably never really go to happy hours. Well, not never, but it definitely like it's a lot harder.

Sherry Jiang: 19:00 
 Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 19:02 
 So I feel like I'm at like the point where it's like I still do get to do these things, like just not as often, but like often enough that I'm not miserable.

Sherry Jiang: 19:14 
 Got it. So it's, it's, I guess, like it's different but it's still like enough that like, okay, I'm like baseline still like happy in life about this.

Anya Sorensen: 19:26 
 I like, I'm a very positive person. So like, I like to think more about the positives and realistically, like, I am so much happier doing what I am doing. Like a PhD is like a job. Right. But I am so much happier doing this than I was working at my other job. And like, I'd say like, this is so much better. Even if I'm not spending all of these like fun things, like, it's still so much better for my mental health, like so much less so at the same time, I don't have the similar, like, need to spend and do all of these activities that I used to because I was not super happy at my job and like my co workers, a lot of extremely toxic.

Sherry Jiang: 20:12 
 Yeah. So I guess in a way, like, it's almost like part of the. I guess spending beforehand was like an escape from like day to day job and that kind of like helped get things through. But in a funny way, it's like sometimes when you have less money to spend on these things, you realize it matters maybe a little less because you're like, I'm just happy with what I'm creating and working on.

Anya Sorensen: 20:42 
 Yeah, exactly. I'm happier generally. So I would say that easier to be happy, like, with just what I do instead of like, having to be happy by like, shopping. Because I definitely think I would shop because I would, like, think about like, oh, I can wear this on the weekend, or I can like, you know, wear this on vacation in a period where I will be much happier than I am now. So it's like the thinking and the association, the happiness. Whereas, like now, like, I'm just baseline happier.

Sherry Jiang: 21:18 
 Yeah. And I guess, like, speaking of, like, you know, what you used to do, like, I guess shopping wise, like, do you like, have some examples of like, I guess, habits or things you used to do, Buying stuff, like, to kind of like, maybe one part of it is aspirational. Like, I'm buying this to kind of imagine myself like, somewhere not here or like, sometimes it's like a dopamine hit. Like, what were some things that you used to do?

Anya Sorensen: 21:48 
 Oh, yeah. So I mean, Abercrombie new arrivals drop every Thursday. And so like every Thursday at work I used to have these like, really long standing meetings every, like Thursday morning. I think I would just be in nonstop meetings basically from like 10 to 1. And I would just scroll through, like the new arrivals through like, the particularly, like, boring parts when I wouldn't have to be working or when I wasn't, like, I didn't have to be paying attention. So there was that. I mean, like, I also bought a lot of like, makeup products and like, skin products. Realistically, like, I didn't mean just because, like, it kind of made that part, like, fun because, like, oh, you're trying something new. So definitely, like, I would like, kind of look forward to being able to like, look at new arrivals, like, shop online because I'm a big online shopper more than like going in person, but also like malls around D.C. kind of. And yeah, it was like Getting a new product, trying to do things, having something new, like, was like my source of happiness, I feel like.

Sherry Jiang: 23:06 
 Yeah. And like, when you were doing it, like, did you. How long did you feel like that? Like, I guess little boost would, like, last for you?

Anya Sorensen: 23:20 
 I guess, like, if I. Let's say, like, I bought a new makeup product, it would probably last for, like, I don't know, like a week or two weeks, maybe a month maximum. And I would say, like, new clothes, especially, like in 2025, because I was trying to be more deliberate about spine clothes wise. I would last maybe longer than that. Especially because I grew up in Florida. I'm not really used to shopping for the season, right. Like, buying sweaters, so. And I. For summer as a season, so I would buy, like, stuff when they would start coming out with their summer stuff. And maybe like March, there was people to wear them in D.C. but I think, like, that weight kind of made that dopamine, like, hit, like, last longer.

Sherry Jiang: 24:19 
 Okay. So you're, like, anticipating, like, the summer stuff coming out and.

Anya Sorensen: 24:23 
 Yeah, well. And like, being able to wear the new summer stuff.

Sherry Jiang: 24:27 
 Yeah, Gotcha. Okay. I'm a. I'm a summer person too, so I totally get it.

Anya Sorensen: 24:35 
 Yeah. Right.

Sherry Jiang: 24:38 
 One, like, it's a less unpredictable thing to, like, have to track, keep track of with weather.

Anya Sorensen: 24:45 
 I went to school in New Hampshire, so I have so many sweaters and I have so many, like, clothes that I feel like there isn't that much of a difference between, like, different sweaters and, like, they take up so much space. So you can't have blue sweaters. Because you can. I can't. I don't have. But.

Sherry Jiang: 25:09 
 Yeah. And what did you ever, like, I guess, like, find yourself, I guess, buying stuff that you didn't really end up using as much, but you were like, in the moment you thought, okay, cool, like, I. I definitely am gonna like this. But then it just like sits there.

Anya Sorensen: 25:33 
 Definitely. I think I would say, like. So I graduated in 2022, and right after graduation, I lived in New York and I worked in New York for a year. And I hated my job in New York. I worked with some, like, I'm sorry, The dumbest people I had ever to be honest. Yeah. Like, the things that they said, they were like. They were like. It was a terrible job. My apartment that we had, it was a three bedroom flexed into. Oh, sorry. It was a one bedroom flexed into a three because it was massive apartment. However, the video they sent us, the walls went up to the ceiling in the apartment. We got the walls, like, Walls did not go up to the ceiling. So it's like this bait and switch kind of deal. So it's just like an even worse, I think like doing like you come from college, which is great fun, you know, you're not working, like you're just kind of. You're taking classes, you know, then to that, which I was definitely like not super happy. And So I think D.C. was a lot better than New York. My job better. My co workers were toxic, but better. They were only really toxic in the end, but. So when I lived in New York, I definitely bought a lot of stuff that I never used and I got rid of it all like at the end of that year because like I've never worn this in like six months. Why would I start to wear this now? So definitely was not a great feeling. So I tried to be better about that living in D.C. and I think also like again in D.C. i was like baseline happier that I was in New York, so that was easier to not do as well.

Sherry Jiang: 27:34 
 Yeah, yeah. And that it's like each place you go to is like a step happier, which is, which is good, right? I think that's like how we want to move up in life as well.

Anya Sorensen: 27:46 
 Yeah. I mean, I think like I could have stayed in D.C. and been like happy. I mean like the people maybe experience like toxic in the end. They've since left, since I left. So it would have just been about like transitioning somehow there, you know. But it is nice intellectually to be back in like something that I really like. So.

Sherry Jiang: 28:14 
 Yeah. And no, it sounds like, you know, doing a program is like a really like intellectually like enriching experience that you don't just get that from a job. So it's, it's. I guess that's pretty cool.

Anya Sorensen: 28:31 
 And that's the thing is like I kind of, I think because I feel more enriched with what I do, I don't necessarily feel the same need to be enriched with what I buy. So I don't feel urge to like buy everything that I've definitely liked before.

Sherry Jiang: 28:49 
 Yeah, for sure. And I guess that's like good to also come to that self awareness as well. Because I think that also just like.

Anya Sorensen: 28:57 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 28:57 
 Makes us happier and like also more in control of the kind of habits and like mindset we have.

Anya Sorensen: 29:04 
 Yeah, for sure.

Sherry Jiang: 29:07 
 Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 29:09 
 Awesome.

Sherry Jiang: 29:09 
 Well, thanks for sharing all of that. The second part we're going to be covering will require, I guess. So do you have access to like ChatGPT or like, like a large language model that you're using Yeah, I have.

Anya Sorensen: 29:33 
 Chatgpt that I use.

Sherry Jiang: 29:36 
 Okay, perfect. So how we're going to do this, I'm going to have a prompt to. So there's not like a. We're not gonna do this through like an app app, but I have like a prompt that basically will extract some insights based on some of your spending data. So if you have for this exercise, because I'm curious if you have like a statement that you're willing to use from say you moved in September, maybe like October. I'm just trying to think like when a baseline like LA lifestyle would be maybe like October. Because November, December starts to get into holiday zone. So I definitely don't spend the way I normally spend during the holidays. But I mean that's.

Anya Sorensen: 30:21 
 Yeah, yeah. I mean honestly, like I don't know if I feel like I'm finally getting kind of to the point where it's more stable because like September, I moved at the end of September. So October was like buying a lot things that I didn't have. And then November I think giving. And my cat got sick in oh, November and then December was the holidays and now we're. So I don't have like a routine one necessarily yet. That would be probably this month or next month.

Sherry Jiang: 31:04 
 Yeah. Actually do you have like. We could also, I mean if there's like a two week period in January that you feel like is more routine, we can also look at that.

Anya Sorensen: 31:20 
 Okay. Yeah. So like.

Sherry Jiang: 31:26 
 Let me think it's the 25th right now. So yeah, like if I think, I guess things start to kind of normalize after the first week of January. So we can try that if that's more normal because I totally get it. Like when you're moving it's like you're buying furniture, you're like paying for all. Just honestly it's like not representative of how you normally spend.

Anya Sorensen: 31:46 
 So yeah, I paid my auto insurance like startup which was like 400, which is not how I usually spend in October. But yeah. So you say like statement, do you want. I probably don't have a statement from January yet. Do you want.

Sherry Jiang: 32:03 
 Yeah, yeah, I think screenshots work are. Honestly, if you just like so on like your like because you usually have like a running statement if you just like copy the lines. Actually the chat GPT can just read it. So that's probably okay. I'll just send you the prompt. It's pretty simple.

Anya Sorensen: 32:24 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 32:25 
 Let me just get you this. And then yeah, once you have that ready, just let me know if you can like share your screen and we can like walk through things.

Anya Sorensen: 32:47 
 Let me, let me copy and paste this. Or. I guess I'm trying to like, think about what the best way to do this is because I have, I have the apps on my phone and if I take screenshots of the statement, it's going to exceed the number of like, picture I can do.

Sherry Jiang: 33:46 
 Let me see.

Anya Sorensen: 33:48 
 I mean, I could use like. I mean I have like a TJ Maxx credit card. The states are probably like fairly consistent, but that's just T.J. maxx. So that's.

Sherry Jiang: 34:03 
 Let me see. I'm trying to think as well.

Anya Sorensen: 34:14 
 Yeah. Because if I look back at august, october, Like, that's not like none of them are. The other thing is like my parents send me money to buy things for them here. So then that skus with my credit card statements because I'm not spending grand on Amazon. Right. But they needed certain things in America.

Sherry Jiang: 34:54 
 The other thing we can do is we can look at something from like October, November and December, the full statements. What the prompt does is it just splits it into like categories and merchants. So we can just kind of ignore the ones that are not typical spends.

Anya Sorensen: 35:20 
 Okay. Or what if we used one from like March of last year?

Sherry Jiang: 35:28 
 Yeah, that's also okay if you. Yeah, we can try that. Some things will be probably harder to remember because, you know, we're human, but we can, we can give that a try. I guess that would be your life back in D.C. then.

Anya Sorensen: 35:46 
 Yeah. Or I'm. I'm looking at them to see like, September might not. September might not be bad actually, if you ignore the moving charge.

Sherry Jiang: 36:20 
 Okay, yeah, let's. We can try that. Then we can just ignore the furniture moving stuff. That's fine.

Anya Sorensen: 36:38 
 Let me just get it to my computer. It. Okay, let me copy and paste the transactions because it's saying my file is protected.

Sherry Jiang: 38:16 
 Yeah, no problem.

Anya Sorensen: 38:19 
 I'm a screenshot. I think it's really embarrassing that it's going to say my number one store is pet smart.

Sherry Jiang: 38:53 
 That's not embarrassing. It's a. I have two cats, so I get it.

Anya Sorensen: 39:00 
 Yeah. What kind of cat do you have? I have a domestic short hair. His name is Carrot.

Sherry Jiang: 39:19 
 See an orange tabby or.

Anya Sorensen: 39:25 
 No, I'll be honest. So here, I can share my screen too. Yeah, Add in one more. Screenshot at the end. No. So he is a gray and white domestic, short hair. I foster failed him when I was in D.C. and I picked him because I thought based on his name that he would be orange. And I was like, oh, I've never had an orange. Cat before, but he's like this gray, like overweight cat and it's like actually kind of weird because he looks like exactly like my brother's cats. Let me add in this. He looks exactly like my brother's cat, that they could be siblings.

Sherry Jiang: 40:36 
 That's cute.

Anya Sorensen: 40:40 
 I'm going to add this screenshot and ask it to recap it. I've reached my upload. I understand that they make these like super hard to copy and paste from for like security, but it's not particular.

Sherry Jiang: 41:17 
 Yeah, I know, it's annoying.

Anya Sorensen: 41:23 
 Okay, So this is what it gave me.

Sherry Jiang: 41:38 
 Okay.

Anya Sorensen: 41:41 
 It's recalculating with this information. Should I tell to ignore my moving charge and like. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 41:52 
 Yeah, you can say ignore.

Anya Sorensen: 41:56 
 And Emily Joyce was one for my parents, so that's not relevant either. Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 42:13 
 Oh, I think it also did it put. Oh, I guess dmv, they put in transport. But I mean, that's probably a necessity. Kind of spend like once a year probably as well. Yeah. Is Trader Joe's your regular grocery spot?

Anya Sorensen: 42:42 
 Yeah, I would say I try to go to Trader Joe's the most just because it's cheaper than route and better quality, like smart and final. I used to really like Aldi because you could get their organic food at like the same cost as like regular food. But it's I think like a half hour drive. So like not worth it anymore.

Sherry Jiang: 43:10 
 Yeah, makes sense. I'm actually curious for like shop being because it seems like ikea, Ikea and Target, like also moving stuff as well.

Anya Sorensen: 43:32 
 I'd say Ikea, I bought a new dresser that I wanted but didn't need. I would say Target's probably a combo of moving stuff, maybe like $30. And then the rest would probably be split between like, food and like general shopping.

Sherry Jiang: 43:55 
 Okay. Oh, you do like groceries as well at Target, right alongside Ralph's and Trader Joe's or.

Anya Sorensen: 44:02 
 Yeah, I would say so, like, I would say I do my groceries like mainly at Trader Joe's. Probably like 80% of my groceries. And then I would say maybe like 5% at Costco. Like things like snacks, eggs, fruit, and then another 10% at like Trader Joe. Sorry, 10%, like Target if it's convenient. If I like need something specific that I know they like, have and are typically like not too expensive for. And then Ralph's is that final, like 5%. It's walking distance from me. So it's like stuff that I. Yeah, I mean you can see like most frequent. It's stuff like when I'm like, oh, I forgot to get this one thing that I need for dinner, I'll run to Ralph's.

Sherry Jiang: 44:54 
 Okay, Gotcha. Gotcha. But Ralph's is mostly, I guess you still be like, cooking most of the stuff that you get from Ross.

Anya Sorensen: 45:02 
 Yeah, It's like, oh, I forgot butter. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 45:17 
 I'm kind of curious. You have a six on shopping. I see three here. Do you know what the other six might.

Anya Sorensen: 45:24 
 Might be?

Sherry Jiang: 45:25 
 Or maybe it's the same multiple times that IKEA and Target.

Anya Sorensen: 45:32 
 I would say that one of them is definitely Petsmart. Oh, okay. One or two is Petsmart. Yeah, here's Petsmart. $64 at Petsmart. And then another one is Chewy.

Sherry Jiang: 45:45 
 Oh, is it an online store for, like, pet stuff?

Anya Sorensen: 45:49 
 Yeah. Have you never heard of Chewy before? I highly recommend. Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 45:56 
 Yeah. Do you get like, like, toys or food from shoe or like, all. All the above.

Anya Sorensen: 46:05 
 I get all the above. So Chewy. So my cat is on a prescription diet for urinary problems. And I like, just have the prescription for his food, like, uploaded and they auto ship it to me every month. I also get, like, his prescriptions from Chewy. I used to get kitty litter from them, but, like, now the shipping, it's just like, too cumbersome. So I don't want it delivered every month. Like, I just do it as needed in smaller quantities from petsmart. They have toys, they have clothes, they have cat trees, so.

Sherry Jiang: 46:50 
 Got it. I'll. I'll have to check it out. What, what do you normally I just curious, like, you went to petsmart and like, Chewy, like, do you have, like, certain things you get from both that are different?

Anya Sorensen: 47:05 
 Yeah, I would say. I used to order kitty. I used to order almost everything exclusively from Chewy when I lived in D.C. see, because it was, like, really easy. It was easier for me to have things shipped to me and delivered to my apartment than it was to go pick them up. But that was because, like, I lived in, like, a doorman concierge building. Whereas now I live in a building that, like, you have to buzz people in if they're delivering something and half the time it doesn't work. So it's like, kind of hard to get things delivered. So I have to order everything through, like a pickup spot. And because of that, I don't like to order the bulkier items. Like, it's just too heavy to order food and like 40 pounds of calorie all at one time. So yeah, for sure order his food and his toys and whatever, his prescriptions to Chewy and from Pet Spot. I will pick up the cat litter. And then if I need anything urgent, like food urgently, I will also grab that from petsmart. So I think in this one I probably bought from petsmart like some cans of his wet food, a big thing of cat litter, and also like I do like regular cat litter and a separate box of pretty litter. So it's probably those three in this order.

Sherry Jiang: 48:55 
 Got it. Yeah. I think, like, looking. Can you scroll down a bit more? These are just GPTs, summaries. It feels like. Yeah, I think this is correct. Your post move spending is stable and predictable. I mean, it feels like most things are pretty deliberate, right? It's like things that you needed for the cat or things that you need to like make food from groceries and survive.

Anya Sorensen: 49:31 
 I definitely try to be more. I've definitely. I mean, I am 25. I graduated three years ago, so I definitely feel like I have kind of learned to make it more intentional and controlled.

Sherry Jiang: 49:50 
 Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 49:50 
 Is there.

Sherry Jiang: 49:51 
 Is there anything like when you're looking at this like that stood out to you or surprised you, like, a little bit or like, was most things, like, I kind of expected this. This looks pretty, pretty in line. I guess.

Anya Sorensen: 50:05 
 Like the one thing I would say is like, Oh, this is a moving charge. ASI select insurance. I would say probably subscriptions. The fact that I have $40 of subscriptions from Apple is kind of stands out to me because I do have Apple Care. I guess I've never actually sat down and added up all of the charges.

Sherry Jiang: 50:39 
 Like, the $40 seems like, I guess higher than you would have expected it to be.

Anya Sorensen: 50:46 
 Yeah, it seems higher than I would have expected it to be. Although, like, it does feel like when I think about it, I'm like, okay, that makes sense. But I'm like, wow, I'm spending $40 a month just on like Applecare that I've never used. Feels a bit steep. But I would say also seeing this, like this Uber line in September, I think I took like two Ubers. Like this Curb Taxi was like my Uber or was my like see ride from the airport to my apartment. So like, that to me is fine. But like, I think I definitely took like maybe two Ubers in. In September. So it's kind of like a shock that it's like $4. That's not like anything crazy, right? But it's definitely. I would say it reaffirms why I don't go to happy hours and like drinking like out as much here. Because two Ubers is $40. I mean, in D.C. like, each Uber was about like $10. So just like, a big, like, double the price here compared to. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 52:13 
 I guess when you're looking at it, you're like, wow, I just went out. I guess two Ubers is like, you went out one night and you're like, oh, one night was like, this. Plus, like, whatever I paid in drinks, which starts to feel like that could have been a dinner or that could have been, like, new treats for the cat or something like that.

Anya Sorensen: 52:34 
 Yeah, like, it could have just been, like, more kind of, like, productive money that I would have enjoyed more than just, like, spending it on an Uber. Like, what I think this was was probably. I think, like, two nights out I got one way, and then someone else got the Uber the other way. So if I had done it, like, on, like, it'd be easily double this. So, I mean, like, at the end of the day, like, $40 is, like, not that bad to spend on Uber, but it's just like, kind of like, comparison. Like, it used to be significantly cheaper. Like, this probably used to be my monthly Uber spend if I went out every weekend. Wow.

Sherry Jiang: 53:25 
 Okay. Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 53:26 
 Because I take the Metro to wherever I was going, and I would Uber home. I mean, maybe my Uber spend would have been, like, $50 in D.C. for, like, every week. Taking one Uber back home every week. But. I also spent a lot of money on groceries would be, like, the other thing, because I would definitely spend probably this, if not more when I was in D.C. because a lot of times, like, I would have my boyfriend over and I would cook or we would just, like, eat more food at my apartment. And that was, like, never something I, like, thought more about. But, like, $340, when it was like, just me here only feeding myself, I was probably, like, like, looking at this now and thinking about it. It was like, probably like me learning, okay, I need to be more deliberate about where I do my grocery shopping and, like, what groceries I buy here. Because it does add up facts. And I think that was kind of the vibe September and maybe October grocery shopping. Because, like, I never thought about groceries, like, grocery prices before in, like, D.C. right? If something, like, looked good, like, it was groceries, I wasn't buying caviar, but, like. But. I am proud of my subscriptions. Even Apple is $40 to only have Apple Netflix. And I know my other transaction would be Hulu, and I think that's still $2 a month. I would say seeing this insurance cost hurts just because I used to pay $100 a month for insurance in D.C. and I had way better coverage than I do here.

Sherry Jiang: 55:54 
 Yeah, Some things are just more expensive in California. I mean, it's.

Anya Sorensen: 55:59 
 Yeah. And it doesn't. It's kind of interesting. It doesn't look like it's showing up necessarily in transport, but I would say I definitely spent a lot of money on parking in September in California. And like, I don't really, like, the math isn't mathing for me. So I don't know if it's being factored somewhere else, which it might be, because, I mean, Smog Solutions should not be health and fitness. Yeah. But I definitely. So, like, I used to live in New York and I used to live in D.C. and like, in both of those places, you can basically never find free parking. Right. So I kind of, like, internalized not being able to find free parking in the city and since learned that there are lots of options for free parking in la. You just need to put a little bit more effort into it. So I probably easily spent like, I don't know, like, maybe $60 in parking in September, if not more. That's just like a couple trips to the beach. Oh, here's maybe one of those parkings. $5 Venice Boulevard.

Sherry Jiang: 57:32 
 Oh, that looks.

Anya Sorensen: 57:34 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 57:34 
 Put under dining, which is probably not correct.

Anya Sorensen: 57:38 
 Yeah. And I guess, like, I don't know, I guess thinking as like, like the import, like, how this information, like, would help me, like, I feel like sometimes, like, my shopping habits maybe get a little bit by this.

Sherry Jiang: 58:29 
 Right.

Anya Sorensen: 58:31 
 Because if we look at like, the spending for, like, pet stuff, I definitely bought things in this month that he didn't need. And I can tell that by the numbers because, like, his, his wet food every month is like $70. Another bag of. I. I still had dry food, I think, back in September, and his litter, like, would have been like $12. So I definitely spent, you know, easily $60 on. Probably on. I think I got him, like, more toys that he didn't necessarily need. So, like, this kind of doesn't reveal that, right? Because I guess it doesn't. It would have to know how much I regularly spend in a month on pet stuff. But at the same time, like, if every month I buy stuff he doesn't need, then you're still like, obscuring that buying of stuff like that kind of like, I guess, like, reckless spending.

Sherry Jiang: 59:50 
 I guess if you were to, like, look at this, right? There's a few things that you, like, highlighted, like the groceries, the cabs, and yeah, I guess the shopping spend. Right.

Anya Sorensen: 01:00:03 
 Like.

Sherry Jiang: 01:00:05 
 I guess. What kind of stuff do you feel like now reflecting on this were like, not the most Necessary spend. And again, it's fine to spend on things that are just for fun sometimes. But then what were some things where you're, like, looking back, it didn't add too much value. And it could have been a skip.

Anya Sorensen: 01:00:29 
 I mean, I'll be honest. Like, every month, I probably buy. Like, I buy. Not probably. Like, I do buy stuff for my cat that, like, toys that he never plays with. So definitely some of that pet smart money probably could have been a skip. And, I mean, he was. I got him in April. He was, like, returned to the shelter. So I think I buy him a lot of things because he was returned by his previous family. Yeah. I think also looking at, like, the food, I mean, it's hard always to say, like, I feel like a scrooge when I say, like, oh, spending on groceries was, like, unnecessary. But it's like, I am a small person. I don't eat that much, and I don't have, like, I. I'm not somebody who, like, needs to have, like, avocado. Like, I don't know. I don't feel like my general eating habits are super expensive. So this kind of like, looks like, to me, like. And like, I know myself also that it's like, I probably bought too much of certain things and, like, some stuff might have gotten to waste. So, like, there might. Like, there probably were things that I bought in September that, like, I either, like, I probably bought too much fruit. It's something like, it was a bad habit, like, in the beginning when I moved here because, like, when it was me and my boyfriend, like, I could always. Like, if fruit was going bad, I could just be like, okay, we need to finish this, and it would go away where it's like, here, there's only so much fruit. Like, I can eat on my own. So that probably happened here. I definitely don't think I spend $350 on groceries now because I just don't. $350 worth of food, I'd say.

Sherry Jiang: 01:02:31 
 Got it.

Anya Sorensen: 01:02:43 
 But it does make me feel, like, really, like. Like, I'm not doing too bad of a job even, like, when moving. So, like, I. I definitely bought, I think, workout clothes from Target. Or, like, decor from Target that I might not necessarily have needed, but at the end of the day, it's not. I've definitely done worse.

Sherry Jiang: 01:03:12 
 Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 01:03:19 
 And I would say, like, kind of unrelated, but it's since you guys are designing, like, an app or, like, features to kind of, like, help, you know, people like, my age, like, early career women, as I think, like, what it said One thing I did struggle with always in, like, the three years before, like, coming here was I typically never had.

Sherry Jiang: 01:03:48 
 A.

Anya Sorensen: 01:03:52 
 Like, I would say, like, most. Probably the longest, like, my paycheck went stable was like three or four months. Like, at my first job, if we did well in the beginning, they would, like, give us, like, commission or we'd get, like, quarterly bonuses. And then in my second job, there were like, different periods throughout the year that they would do, like, pay increases. Like, I think I started in June there. And then I got a bonus in September and a pay increase in October. And then I got another, like, inflationary pay increase in April, followed by the next, like, bonus pay increase. Oh, then I got a promotion in June, and then that was followed by the bonus and like, pay increase that following fall. So, like, It would always be like a little bit, like, unpredictable by like a few, like, hundred dollars to maybe like a couple thousand dollars. Not a couple thousand dollars, but like $1,000 early on. And like, I don't know, I think that sometimes, like, makes it harder to budget because, like, you, when you feel like you have that extra money, like, oh, I just got this paycheck that was like $300 more. It can, like, trigger, at least for me. Like, it would, like, kind of trigger those bad habits. I'd be like, oh, like, I can go buy that handbag. You know, I just made this money. But then it's like, kind of reaffirming, like, the habit that, like, you can't do that, you know?

Sherry Jiang: 01:05:50 
 Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 01:05:55 
 And like, of course, like, with my credit card spending habits, like, here, like, you wouldn't see that. But I know that is, like, something and like, I would probably compensate, like, thinking back on, like, when that would happen in New York. Can I stop sharing my screen or do you still need to.

Sherry Jiang: 01:06:18 
 Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. I have like, one more minute if that's okay, as I do have to go. But finish your thought because I appreciate you sharing so much.

Anya Sorensen: 01:06:30 
 Yeah, I couldn't see the time, like, but yeah, when I was in New York, I would, like, get a quarterly, like, pay. I like, quarterly bonus. And then, oh, I can go buy this thing. And then the next month I'd be like, oh, actually I should have saved that money. So I'm going to try to spend less this month, which then that restriction that makes you want to spend more money. So kind of like this, like, uneven cycle because, like, I pay would change. And obviously it's great to make more money, but, like, I didn't necessarily know how to, like, handle that at the time, I guess, but that was my last thought. Sorry.

Sherry Jiang: 01:07:13 
 Yeah, I know. No, don't apologize at all. Thanks for your time. Anya. This has been really helpful, and thanks for being so open as well, especially on this topic. Yeah, we'll. We'll, like, take what we kind of learned from this and then work on, like, improving the product. But, yeah, thank you so much for your time. Really appreciate it. Yeah.

Anya Sorensen: 01:07:40 
 And sorry.

Sherry Jiang: 01:07:43 
 It's okay. And then I'll go and see how we can, like, get the scheduling and the comp stuff resolved. I have it noted down to take care of that. But thank you so much for your time.

Anya Sorensen: 01:07:55 
 Yeah. Thank you so much. Best of luck. Thank you. All right, take care.
