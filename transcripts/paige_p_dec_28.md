Paige

Good. How's it going, Paige? 
P
Paige P
00:02
Going so far so good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:05
That's good, that's good. Thanks for joining. I know it's a bit late, but appreciate you taking the time. I also want to mention Jaslyn from our team is also on this call just to like shadow and learn as well in case you're like, oh, who's that other person? But yeah. 
P
Paige P
00:26
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:28
Thanks for the time last time. It was very helpful and thanks for being super honest and sharing everything. How we're going to do things this time is focus more on a next version of the app that we've actually built through a link. All you have to do is have a bank statement ready in a PDF form that you can upload and then use it. Just like the drill last time. Just use the app naturally as you would. Don't worry about. Okay, like what do I think Sherry wants me to do? Like, don't worry about it. Just do what Paige wants to do. 
P
Paige P
01:04
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:04
It's fun to keep exploring, keep doing it. If something is like, okay, not that interesting, whatever you click out of it, like just be as natural as possible. Share your screen and then just like voice out loud, like what's going through your head, like stream of consciousness. 
P
Paige P
01:19
I'm going to get that bank statement ready right now actually. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:23

Awesome. And in the meantime what I'm going to do is I'm also going to send you the link to what you're going to be linked to the app. If you go into the chat of the hangout, you should be able to see after the fireflies message there's a link called Book Peak Money that is a link that you're going to be using. Take your time to set up. Once you're. You take a couple minutes and once you're ready to go, just let me know and start sharing screen and we can go ahead. 
P
Paige P
01:55
Book Peak Money. I just saved the file for the PDF. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:00
Yeah, yeah, bring it in. Just by the way, as a heads up, this is the first time we're using this link on a mobile device, so I think it should work. But let's see as I'm gonna manage. 
P
Paige P
02:19
Understood. I'm sorry about this. Like mic. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:21
No, it's okay. 
P
Paige P
02:22
Iffy right now and I'm just like, I'm. It's like a 10 year old computer and I really need it for this semester and like I could tell that it's like slowly starting to crash out on me and I'm like, I really don't need this to happen. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:38
No worries. 
P
Paige P
02:41
I'm trying to remember which email I even used for my peak account. Okay, so on this one, just share my screen. Is this working? 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:29
Yes. I can see. 
P
Paige P
03:31
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:31
I think you. Yeah, you have to click into. Yep. 
P
Paige P
03:37
Perfect. So. This bank statement and then continue. So this is for the month of December, just so you all are aware. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:54
Gotcha. 
P
Paige P
03:57
I have a lot of very random stuff, especially whenever I come home because there's no casinos in Tennessee. I like to enjoy it whenever I'm home. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:07
All good. No judgment. 
P
Paige P
04:09
Just. Just giving a fair warning. But I do think it takes my face off of it. I tried putting my camera on and it won't let me put my camera back on. Just so you're aware, like, I am still here. It just won't let me put my face while I'm screen sharing on my phone. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:23
Yeah, no problem. I think that's. I think that might be by design. 
P
Paige P
04:31
Perfect. I just wanted to double check. I just didn't know if you, like, needed it to be like, all right, like, I need to make sure that you're here and all that. And I was like, all right, I promise. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:38
Yeah, yeah. Just. Just verbally articulate things more. So like, if you, like, are surprised by something and you're making a facial expression, I won't be able to see it. So that's the only thing understandable. 
P
Paige P
04:52
I'm just waiting for it to process because it is taking a minute. But it's probably just because the amount of different transactions that could be on the statement. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:00
Yeah, I'll take like a minute or two. Let's. Let's see. I'm just like, fingers crossed. Hoping it's gonna be okay. We have an alternative in case it doesn't. But it's always better to be able to process your own. 
P
Paige P
05:15
That's valid. I also feel like a lot of people probably will use Peak anyway on their phone more than they would like. I don't know. I use mine on my phone. I don't really use it on the computer. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:24
Yeah. So the reason. So we're doing all the testing on the web link right now, but eventually the changes that we're going to make based on, like, feedback we get on this particular app, we're going actually move into the mobile app. So it is. It is meant to be on mobile eventually. But it's. It's a little bit easier to spin up a web app at the current moment than push it to, like, the App Store. Oh, no. Okay. Darn. Okay. 
P
Paige P
05:52
This is like transaction count mismatch. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:55
Yeah. Okay. Oh, okay. Let me see what I can do here. I can see the error message. Okay. There's two ways we can do this. One is we have you try to use synthetic or fake data, which is an option there. The other option, only if you're comfortable, is if you can send it to me and I can pull it. Try to do it on my computer. But you would just have to tell me where to click. But that's only if you're comfortable. I would delete everything, but that's fine. 
P
Paige P
06:38
I mean, I'm doing it for research. I know you're not really going to use my data for anything besides this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:45
Yeah, that's not going to do anything with it. Okay. 
P
Paige P
06:51
I'm trying to figure out how I can. Should I email it to you? 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:56
Yeah, you can. Let me just. Yeah, just email it to me. 
P
Paige P
07:02
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:02
I'm just gonna. Okay. 
P
Paige P
07:23
I believe it. Yeah. There. I probably should have taken my account number or whatever out. But it's fine. I don't care. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:38
I'll delete it, I promise. 
P
Paige P
07:42
I trust. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:50
Okay, let me just. Let me download this. So basically we're going to try to do it this way. We're going to try to have you navigate with me through your own stuff and then just tell me what to type. And then I think I'll try to have you do a version with fake data just to see how you interact without me controlling it. But I think at least at the get go, it's helpful for you to see how it looks like with your own data. Okay, perfect. Okay. A bank statement. All right, now I guess I'm gonna have to present. Let me just pull this up. My screen is. Let's see. Chrome Tab P concept testing. Okay, cool. I think this is it. Can you see everything here? 
P
Paige P
08:40
Yes, I can. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:41
Okay, cool. All right, we are ready to roll. I'm just gonna just. Yeah, like now I can see your face, which is great. But you can just like tell me what's on your mind. React to stuff. I'm just gonna. We're gonna just give this a try and see how it works. Perfect. I'm crossing my fingers. I don't have the error as well. 
P
Paige P
09:00
I'm like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:00
Okay, please. 
P
Paige P
09:02
I mean, if you did though, I mean it would come up and like that could be something that y' all can use. So like that's a good thing. Oh, like it like sucks, but it's a good thing. At least it's with me and it's not like I have to the public yet, you know? 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:14
Yeah. Processing. 
P
Paige P
09:16
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:16
It seems like, it should work because I'm not getting an error message yet. Let me just see. Right. So in the world of software, if you're not getting the error popping up right away, it's usually a good thing because it means it's processing because we got the error, like, I think faster than this. I know it sounds kind of counterintuitive because you're just like, oh, my gosh, like, why is it so fast? So you tell me I'm doing something wrong, but that's a good thing usually in software. All right. 
P
Paige P
09:55
No. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:56
Okay. I'm just wondering if it's like the. Okay, maybe. Yeah. Okay. 
P
Paige P
10:03
It has more than it did whenever I had mine. Oh. So unless you have to try again and maybe it'll go up and, like, it'll finally get it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:13
Maybe. Yeah. 
P
Paige P
10:16
Because the last one, it said it was like 145 out of, like, 157 or so. Yeah, it said expected 145, got 138 at handler on my error message. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:29
Yeah, it's weird. Okay. You know, we're going to abort and do it this way to have a. Use fake data. I'm sorry. It's okay. 
P
Paige P
10:41
I think we made a. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:42
We made a change perhaps on something and it just broke. So we're going to adapt. Okay, so now I'm going to have you go back to the original site and then just click, like, mock data. 
P
Paige P
11:01
Okay. So I'm gonna do. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:03
We won't have the casino spends, but maybe you also go to coffee and stuff. 
P
Paige P
11:07
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:07
Yeah, use sample data instead. Yeah, perfect. 
P
Paige P
11:19
I will say, though, like, it was very quick, though. Like, even though it did get the error message, it was very quick getting the data and then like, being like, okay, out of this much with, like, how many transactions I do have. I like that it's like a little storytelling type of thing. I like how it, like, is very intuitive with, like, the questions about it and, like, how it has, like, different things. I like the custom click. Like, where it's like you can like, actually, like, say instead, like, how these. Where it's like, planned. Fine. Spontaneous pick where it's like. The midweek finds often reveal sudden spark. Was this item meant for a specific movement? Like, I like how it's like, you can customize it where it's like, instead of spontaneous or plain, you just be like, oh, gift or something. 
P
Paige P
12:26
Like, where it's like, specific instead of it just being, like, one of the few. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:31
And when you said that this first piece feels intuitive. Can you explain, like, what's going through your head when you think intuitive. 
P
Paige P
12:41
Like, it's just like it like makes an idea. Like, it kind of like the way that I think of it is that it notices like the category of the brand that it's being used and then it makes a comment about it and then it makes you think about like, oh, what are you doing? Or what are you trying to do? Instead of it just being like you spent this amount doing this, like, it kind of makes you like think about it, like, process, like the reason as to why you chose certain things. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:09
Especially. 
P
Paige P
13:10
Coffee kitchen, where it's like, is this where you gather your thoughts? Like, not many people would think about the fact, like, oh, like, maybe this is why I like to go do things at a coffee shop. And like you just go. Because it's like a ritual type of thing. But like, it's like making you think like, okay, like, what is like the sole purpose of me going? Like, is it just because I need caffeine and I'm not making it at home or is it because, like, it helps me focus more? 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:34
Got it. So in a way you felt like it was able to get at a deeper meaning and question related spend than just like, okay, you spend something here. 
P
Paige P
13:44
Correct. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:46
Okay. 
P
Paige P
13:53
I like the weeks thing though too, because it like slows it down. Like, I guess like how it's like this first to the seventh, eighth to the 14th, where it's like, because certain weeks are different than others. I mean like my first week of December, completely different because I was at school. And then like my second week of December, like, if I was looking at like my account, second week of December I was home. So it was like completely different. So like, it kind of does like a summary and I like how you can like click it and it kind of like tells you like the different people and like what you're doing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:27
Got it. So you like the weekly breakdown because for you, like, that's there's enough meaningful difference between these that like, you want to look at them separately. 
P
Paige P
14:35
Yes. And also like, if you don't realize it, I mean, like I'm in nursing school, so like one week I may have a bunch of exams and like, that'll be like a completely different spending habit than like a week where it's like I have a week off from having any exams. So like, it helps like break down. Like, okay, well this is what you're doing whenever you don't, like whenever you can't or don't have time to like do other things besides studying. Like, this is what you're doing whenever you have that available time. And it's like, all right, well, what am I putting my money towards if I'm bored? I guess I could say, like, what am I, like, aiming towards? Like, what should I be more conscientious about? 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:13
Oh, sorry. When you said that you might be spending money when you're bored, could you explain that a bit more? 
P
Paige P
15:19
I mean, like, you know how there's that saying where it's like, usually you eat whenever you're bored because you don't have anything else to do? 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:26
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
15:27
Like, I feel like at times it's like, you spend money more easily whenever you're bored because it gives you something, like, some sort of, like, purpose and, like, being like, okay, well, I could do this, I could do that. Like, this is what I'm doing with my life right now. And you're, like, doing stuff. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:40
Yeah. Do you have an example that you can think of, like, recently where you felt that way? 
P
Paige P
15:46
Well, I mean, I guess we could use, like. I mean, I'm home, so, like, the casino. I got time to do that. Like, sports betting. Like, I don't really do it. Like, I do a little bit on Sundays, but, like, I have, like, Mondays and Thursdays. Like, I'm watching the games, and, like, I'm bored if I'm just watching it. But it gives, like, more purpose whenever you actually have something to, like, okay, like, my money is going towards this, but then if I were at home or not at home, if I were at school, it's more. So, like, I don't really have time to do this. Like, I'm just gonna buy my groceries. I'm gonna. If I go out for, like, Margarita Monday, I just get, like, my margaritas. 
P
Paige P
16:18
But then I'm coaching that day, so it balances out, like, boring stuff that I do during school. But then when I'm bored at home because I have nothing else that I have, like, responsibilities for, my spending habits are totally different. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:28
Yeah. Got it. And, I mean, how does that make you feel? Like, is that something you're like, I'm kind of okay with, but I just want to be aware, or you're like, oh, like, I wish I did less than that. 
P
Paige P
16:42
I mean, like, it's not like. I feel like. I mean, obviously, like, I don't have a problem with it, so, like. Like, I don't have a problem, so I could always stop. Like, it's not like, yeah. Like, it's like, all right, if I'm putting in X amount, like, I know that I Need to stop if I reach X amount. So, like, I'm very conscientious when I think about it. Yeah, it's just like when I look at it, I'm like, oh, freak. I really hope I make enough where it covers it. Like, you know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:05
Okay, so it's more just like a. Like a visual FYI that you just want to have. 
P
Paige P
17:10
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:11
Okay, got it. Okay, continue. 
P
Paige P
17:13
Yeah, so, like, I like these. I mean, on this. Because it's really only like the this week and like the peak, like numbers of them, the weeks. Like, should I like the magnets? Because, like, kind of like, I guess is the magnets for, like, if you start doing like, things numerous times, like, it like shows up on there to like, tell you, like, what you're doing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:35
Yeah. Actually, I'm going to show you what the mat. How to get the magnet. It might not be as obvious. Go up, like, scroll up. Click on something within Urban Outfitters. Like, maybe just think about your last shopping spin and like, what was. Even if it wasn't Urban Outfitters, like, what was most likely. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And then this is like sample. So this is sample questions to show you the chat. So you just have to click on the. Oh, my gosh. Is this. Oh, the formatting might be really weird. Let me see. Try it again on like nulli and see what happens. I'm just hoping the chat say, try it out. Click on I love croissants. Like, just click on the. The dotted line box. Yeah. 
P
Paige P
18:28
Okay. Oh, and then like, if you click like the person. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:33
So click Alex. And then, you know, memory saved. And then, yeah, click on the park. 
P
Paige P
18:40
So that's cute. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:41
And then if you click next, it'll show you what how to collect these. 
P
Paige P
18:45
Oh, that's cute. I like this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:49
So yeah, it's like it gets to know you and then give you like a magnet. 
P
Paige P
18:54
Oh, I like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:58
Because it'll be in there. 
P
Paige P
19:00
Yeah, Yeah, I do like that. Okay. Yeah. And then, like, I like where it's like this thing. Like, if I were to choose, like, morning ritual, like, what part feels most grounding for you? Because then, like, it's also like, more intuitive, like I said. And I like how it like, breaks down the amount. So like, it's like here where it says, like, how much you spent in that week. But then, like, if you like, click it and like, have that conversation, like, it like, tells you, like, what you spent on that one specific finding. I like this. I do like this one a little bit more than the other one. Like it's not like the other one was bad, but it was just like, I feel like this one's a little bit more, like, conversational with you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:47
And can you describe, like, what you mean by you felt like this one was more conversational with you in a way that you liked it better? 
P
Paige P
19:56
So this is. It might be like, a terrible reference. Like, you know, like Barbies. And like, there's like the Barbie movie. Like, you could like, choose. Like, there was like, the movie that came out where if you had the TV remote, you could choose what you wanted to. Like, make a different story with different outcomes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:10
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
20:11
Like, it's like I'm able to. Like, you're able to talk to the movie basically, and like, it makes different outcomes based off of what your responses are. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:18
Oh, okay. 
P
Paige P
20:19
And I like that it's like what I say changes, like, how the AI talks to me instead of it being a very one way or no way, like my way or the highway type of thing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:29
Yep. 
P
Paige P
20:35
And we also like how on this one, like, if I look at this magnet, like, it says that you can remove it if, like, you're like, oh, no, that's not me type of thing. And about also, like, this kitchen, like, it tells you, like, that's kind of cool that it, like, breaks down every single day. Yeah, I do like this. I like this a lot better. And like, how it, like, lets you see everything that you spent day by day too. And it's not just like, okay, this week. This is like the breakdown. Like, it's like you could, like, go and like, see, like, okay, like, break down each different place and also see the weekly total and how much it contributed to it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:23
And what makes you, like, the detailed breakdown out of curiosity? 
P
Paige P
21:29
I like the detail just because, like, I'm a very analytical thinker. Like, I like to see everything and I like to know everything. So if I don't know everything, I don't feel like everything is complete. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:39
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
21:39
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:40
Gotcha. So you're like, I want to feel a sense of completeness to trust this app. 
P
Paige P
21:45
Yes. Like, I'm very. Like, the way that I think is like, I'm very, like, science based on a lot. Like, I want to see everything. I want to see the evidence. I want to see, like, where you're getting your numbers from. Because if you're just like, oh, yeah, you spent like 40 bucks one week. It's like, okay, well, where did you get that amount from? 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:01
Got it, got it. And then when you could go into that week, you're like, oh, Okay, I. I did go to this restaurant. I did like buy this on Amazon. 
P
Paige P
22:09
Yes, correct. Exactly. I mean, Venmo. I do. I like this one. I feel like everyone uses Venmo too, so like, that's perfect. But yeah, I mean, like, that's really like, I like a lot about like what this is and it makes it more visual and interactive. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:30
Awesome. I actually, by the way, while you were doing this, I tried re uploading your stuff in the app on my side and I actually got it to work. So I'm going to have you actually take a look at. I'm going to present my screen. 
P
Paige P
22:47
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:50
Let me see. 
P
Paige P
22:53
I'm scared. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:55
No, it's okay. Yeah, I hope this is. Does this look accurate? 
P
Paige P
23:01
Oh, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:01
For that. 
P
Paige P
23:02
Yeah, for that month, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:03
Okay, cool. Yeah, like, just tell me what to do like when you're looking at this because I'm going to have to just click through. 
P
Paige P
23:12
I totally forgot. So Van Leeuwens. That's like an ice cream place. Completely forgot about it. But like I completely ate the ground. So like that just like threw me back to it. And it was for my friend because, like it was like a treat for her because she was having like a very anxiety filled week and I was like, oh, okay. Like, yeah, that was for Kaylee. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:30
Yeah. How am I gonna. Okay, I'm gonna try this then. Okay. I'm gonna cut the click through the tutorial too. Sorry, one second. 
P
Paige P
23:40
You're fine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:42
Just click coffee, buddy. 
P
Paige P
23:44
Boom. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:45
All right, so. Yes, thank you. Got it. All right. I got this with my friend Haley. Is that how you spell? 
P
Paige P
24:00
Yeah. H, A, L, E, Y. Whatever. It's a. Yeah, sure. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:05
Because she was having a hard week. 
P
Paige P
24:07
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:08
Okay. 
P
Paige P
24:13
I mean, it was rewarding. I mean, I ended up getting hurt because I fell, but it was nice. It made her feel better. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:20
Oh, you fell. Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. I hope you're okay. 
P
Paige P
24:26
It was honestly so funny. It made her laugh. So it made it even better because she was laughing about it. I was like, all right, well, hopefully this helps you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:33
Yeah, she laughed. It felt better even though I accidentally fell. I love how this chat just completely. Oh, wait, even a little tumble. 
P
Paige P
24:48
Okay. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:49
I thought it ignored the fall part. 
P
Paige P
24:52
I do like how it's like conversating too, but like, yeah, it is how I would like to support them. Like if they're like. If it's like someone that I know that they like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:02
Yeah, I would like to support it. I know it. 
P
Paige P
25:26
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:27
Yeah. So. So this is actually where the chat Would naturally end. 
P
Paige P
25:32
Of course. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:33
We could keep chatting. I was going to just show you how this pops up. So now you see. Is this size. Okay? Can you see everything? 
P
Paige P
25:42
Yeah, I see everything. I can actually, like, shift it, too. Like, I can, like, move the screen so I could see it all, too, if I need to. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:48
Okay, so now you have a dessert lover. 
P
Paige P
25:52
So you got. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:54
And then now you have Haley, so. 
P
Paige P
25:57
Oh, I like that. I think I like that. It's like, you have that conversation with them, and they automatically add it because, like, the name. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:04
Yeah. And let's say, is this real Dolores Park? 
P
Paige P
26:09
I'm unsure. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:11
Okay. No, I think these are fake because this looks like San Francisco. But you should be able to. I think this should be a. Anyways, I'm just gonna ignore that for now. I think you're supposed to be able to drag stuff to Hayley, but for now, you have one activity, and then you have this. That pops up, too. 
P
Paige P
26:31
I like that. Because then it's like, if you, like, are trying to, like, think about, like, okay, why did I spend this? Like, it shows, like, what's good about that Spending, like, what you think is good about it and, like, everything else, like, going down, like, what's iffy and, like, what would you have changed? Like, what's bad? 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:46
Yeah. Okay. All right. What would you click now? I'm just gonna let you guide me. 
P
Paige P
26:54
I probably just, like. Well, obviously, like, I would go through, like, the different things on the top one. Just kind of like how we did for the Van Leeuwen. Okay. Just, like, go through those. I mean, there's a lot. You wanna. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:06
Which. Where do you wanna. 
P
Paige P
27:10
Well, I know most of these literally were either coffee or buying gifts for people. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:17
Okay. 
P
Paige P
27:19
Or if I was drunk, I got Taco Bell. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:26
All right. What? Oh, you did go to Urban Outfitters. Okay, cool. I was gonna say we did have urban in the other one. 
P
Paige P
27:32
I did. That was actually a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. I got him a shirt on Black Friday. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:38
Oh, nice. Nice. Oh, yeah, that makes sense. It was around that time. Okay, which one do you want to click? 
P
Paige P
27:48
I don't know. I mean, sling. We could say that one was the dollar. Because I just wanted to watch, like, one of the Vanderbilt game. Sport games. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:54
Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll say. Custom. Yeah, I wanted to watch the Vander built game. 
P
Paige P
28:08
I'm like. I feel like this one's a little bit different than, like, the trial ones. Because the trial ones are pretty, like, easy. No, I was watching it with my friend Izzy, and it was in our apartment. Did it feel. It was very fun. It was, but it was aggravating, so it wasn't really working. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:33
Oh, okay. So the. The thing didn't work. 
P
Paige P
28:36
Really? Yeah, because it would, like, start and then would pause and, like, freeze. And I'm like, all right, come on. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:46
Try to paraphrase you. 
P
Paige P
28:50
I mean, a dollar is a dollar. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:54
Whatever. Yeah, I think it should collect this as well. 
P
Paige P
29:07
If not. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:10
Maybe it takes a second. It should pop up something. It's okay. I have not. 
P
Paige P
29:16
It's good data for y'. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:17
All. 
P
Paige P
29:18
Oh, wait. Yeah. There it is. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:21
There's a. Here's a flag. 
P
Paige P
29:25
It's, like, in the middle, like, all right. It wasn't really necessary, and it was annoying, but it was fun. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:29
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
29:32
So, yeah, basically, like, I would just go through all those other. And I would probably go to, like, the week by week, I mean, because I was home the 17th, I believe. Yeah, I was home the 17th, and I went back to school the 24th to the 30th. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:46
Got it. 
P
Paige P
29:47
So, like, it kind of shows, like, the different things, which I do. Like, as I was saying, like, I have completely different, like, things that I go through. I mean, like, shift. I know that's, like, my groceries that I get because I have a free prescription. Netflix. I have a Netflix subscription. I have to pay for doordash. I was probably drunk one of the nights and doordashed it. And then Walgreens is like, I needed to get stuff. And then Humphreys was coffee. Because I go with my friend every time. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:11
Yeah. Random question, but if you. So these are all going to be, like, ones that we pick. Would you ever want to, like, I don't know, click any of these to, like, share stuff about it? Or you're like, I would rather just have this section kind of tell me what's important. 
P
Paige P
30:32
I feel like I would rather just have the section tell me what's important. Just so it's not, like, overwhelming with, like, a lot of stuff. And plus, it's like, it might not be things that you think are important until it, like, comes up. Like, you don't think you spend that much at a certain spot because you're like, oh, yeah, it's normal. But, like, you don't think about it until it's, like, in your face. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:51
Makes sense. And then do you. How do you find, like, these different options? Like, is it too many listed? Or you feel like, you know what? That's. That's okay. Like, I feel, like, pretty quick to answer. 
P
Paige P
31:05
I mean, I think it's good, especially like, this DoorDash Taco Bell one, like, looking at. It's like, pure comfort. Save time. And then if I did the customer, I'd be like, I was drunk. I needed food. Because, like, it doesn't. Like, it doesn't have the option for it. And, like, nine times out of 10, like, people probably don't do that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:25
Easy Sounds like something you're craving. Something easy and soothing. 
P
Paige P
31:30
How did it hit you afterwards? Oh, so worth it. Hell yeah, it did. Yep, yep. Yeah. See, they know. They know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:57
Yeah. So let's see. 
P
Paige P
31:59
So, like, that one, Like, I do. Like. Because it's like. Oh, no, it's flag. Dang it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:05
Okay. 
P
Paige P
32:06
Okay. That one, my financial advisor boyfriend literally is like, you need to stop doing this. I'm like, it's fine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:17
Maybe that could be a beige flag. That's fine. Sorry you got put into the red flag. 
P
Paige P
32:24
It's fine. I kind of expected it. It's just worth seeing it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:32
Would it make you feel all right if it ended up as a red flag? 
P
Paige P
32:36
I mean, like, I know it's a red flag, like, but, like, drunk me can't change their mind. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:44
God, that's funny. You know what? It's okay. Talk Crunch Wrap supreme or. 
P
Paige P
32:53
Yup, precisely, actually. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:56
Yeah. I mean. 
P
Paige P
32:59
But I will say, like, I do like how it has a conversation with it. It's not just like, a robot, and it won't, like, interact with that and just be like, oh, I can't talk like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:07
Like, you can talk the way you're talking to actually me or anyone about. 
P
Paige P
33:12
It, Which I like that. So I think this is great. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:18
Cool. I'm gonna have you do one more of these, and then I'm gonna click on this, and I'll try to see what. I'll show you how it looks like. All right. Pick one out of Amazon Prime Fresh Market. Tick Tock Shop. 
P
Paige P
33:35
Honestly, I would say Prime Video, because that one's a unique one. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:39
Oh, okay. All right. Custom. 
P
Paige P
33:43
Yeah. Custom. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:44
Okay. All right, let's go. 
P
Paige P
33:47
My stepbrothers used my account and bought it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:50
Okay. Step brothers use my account. They tell you. 
P
Paige P
33:57
Yeah. After the fact. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:58
Okay. Oh, oh. 
P
Paige P
33:59
Realize, like, the fourth time of it. And I'm like, they told me after. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:04
The fact, after I got charged four times. 
P
Paige P
34:12
Annoyance. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:13
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
34:15
Because it's been multiple. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:20
It's like, you want to set boundaries around this. 
P
Paige P
34:26
I mean, obviously, I would like to, but there's no way to be like, okay, this can't be on here. It can only be on here. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:32
Like, yeah. I mean, I wish I could, but I don't think it's possible. 
P
Paige P
34:45
To need for clear boundaries. And the class shows up. Facts. I said facts. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:56
Okay, It's pretty funny. I wonder if it put it as a. Oh, step brother, come up here. Oh, that's funny. 
P
Paige P
35:13
Use your account and block something with that. I like that. I do like this. Okay, yeah, I like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:22
Sorry, I'm just laughing so much. 
P
Paige P
35:25
You're fine. Don't be sorry. Oh, and it's red. I like that. It's like so interactive like that. That's what this is what I'm talking about. Like the interaction with it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:42
All right, let's try compose now. All right, so this one's more open ended, so you could just say whatever comes to mind. 
P
Paige P
35:51
I guess here it's gotta stop. I need to hit a refresh from the holidays. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:00
I need to hit a refresh from the holidays. Can you see this right now or is it too small? 
P
Paige P
36:07
No, I see, I'm zoomed in on it. So I see like everything I'm saying. Okay, perfect. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:12
I hear you. After holiday rush, what kind of spending would feel more refreshing for you now? 
P
Paige P
36:17
Only essentials like groceries, rent. I mean like not really buying like clothing and stuff. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:23
Not really buying clothing. So you're leaning into the necessary. 
P
Paige P
36:32
Very evil. I feel like it'll help me save money. That's about it. I mean like I don't really have any feelings towards it. Besides needing to save. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:43
Really have other feelings towards it. That's why it's just. Practical side. Okay, it's all about the practical side. Is there any small thing you'd still like to keep in your budget for a bit? 
P
Paige P
36:59
Just like maybe like weekly, like not weekly but like bi weekly coffee dates that I have with some of my friends because like studying, like I go and study with them. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:16
Okay. Cup keeping those coffee studies sound like makes a social connection a little treat. How does that fit with your save more vibe you're aiming for? 
P
Paige P
37:24
I feel like it's better than whatever I've been spending this holiday season. Honestly, being this holiday. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:38
Feels like purposeful spend. What does having these coffee dates give you that the holiday splurges didn't? 
P
Paige P
37:43
Well, it's cheaper to begin with. And also like I'm studying for nursing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:48
And I'm studying for nursing. Okay, makes sense. A low cost habit that also backs in nursing studies. Other small purposeful spends you like to keep while focusing on saving. 
P
Paige P
38:03
I mean, not really. I mean obviously like every now and then I'm gonna go out, but that's Just like, if I decide that I have enough money to do it, like, I'm not really stressed because I don't go out that much. Damn, that's quick. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:24
And that is the conclusion. So you pinpointed a clear reset. Focus on essentials and keep biweekly coffee studies as a date topic. Dates. Study dates as low cost, purposeful boost. Occasional outings are fine. Sounds like you're shaping up a spending pattern that matches savings goals. 
P
Paige P
38:41
I like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:45
Yeah. I think something should pop up on the inbox, but it might not. We'll see. Oh, yeah, there. 
P
Paige P
38:54
I do like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:56
So, yeah, so you get this. You're ready for a spending reset. Focus on essentials occasionally. 
P
Paige P
39:02
I like that it keeps it up on the top too, because it's like a reminder. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:06
Yep. Would you click any of these options or you're like, you know what? That's fine. 
P
Paige P
39:14
I feel like right now, like, I'd probably be like, okay, that's fine. But like, if it was like a couple weeks in and it's like after holidays, whatever, like, yeah, I would go in and check and be like, okay, well, what's this looking like? 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:26
Okay, so would you want to track this then? Because what this can do is like, see how you are doing on the reset. 
P
Paige P
39:32
Yeah, I feel like that would be good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:34
Okay. This track, please chat. 
P
Paige P
39:47
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:49
Yeah. It's giving you a budget template. 
P
Paige P
39:53
I kind of like that. But, like, would that also do that for like, it does that in the app too. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:59
Actually. These budget limits. Not yet. Is that something you would want though? 
P
Paige P
40:06
I feel like that would be kind of cool because it's a two in one of like, tracking and also like, budgeting. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:12
Okay, gotcha. Yeah. I mean, here it's like, here's a template, but that's. We'll keep that in mind to see if we can have this in the app. We also don't want to stress people out too much with like, very strict budgets. But I think it's a. It's a balance. 
P
Paige P
40:30
It could also just be like, oh, this is like what I estimate. Like, you should like spend like a, like the maximum that you should spend. If you want to reach this limit, just be like, oh, like, you don't need to, but if this is what you want to do. So I think whenever you put it in the eyes of like, what people want, it makes them want to do it more and they're less, like, rude about it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:52
Like, make them kind of pick what makes sense. 
P
Paige P
40:56
Yes. Like, it could be like one of like the multiple choice options. Where it's like, okay, like, this is what I think, and, like, these are the options. Like, what do you want to be? Your budget. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:04
Yeah. Would make things easier just going with this exercise, right. Where, like, instead of putting just a number or just a money number, it asks you how many coffee dates you want to go on. You say every. I think bi weekly. Is every two weeks or is it twice a week? 
P
Paige P
41:20
It's every two weeks. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:21
Okay, so it'll be like, okay, like every two weeks. And then it'll ask, okay, how much do you usually, on average have spent? 10 bucks based on the numbers. Does that sound right? Yeah, yeah, It'll be like, 20 bucks is your budget now. Next thing, how often do you want to drink and how. Based on the last time you drink, Here's a Taco Bell and here's the bar tab. Does that sound okay? Something like that. Okay. 
P
Paige P
41:50
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:51
Got it. 
P
Paige P
41:54
Cool, Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:56
Noted on that. Let me just see if this little thing we did together popped up. Yeah. All right, here's your little thing that popped up. Focus on. I like that He's a green flag. 
P
Paige P
42:10
I like it. Yeah. Okay. I have more green flags than red. That makes me feel better. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:14
Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's. It's two times more green flag. So it's good. 
P
Paige P
42:21
Good odds. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:22
Good odds. 
P
Paige P
42:26
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:28
Yeah. That's actually the gist of the app, I would say. I would say that there's one more I am kind of just curious about. It's actually Tick Tock Shop. Like, what. What was this? 
P
Paige P
42:42
That was actually. That was like, Christmas gifts. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:45
Oh, okay. Got it. 
P
Paige P
42:47
Yeah, I bought some Christmas gifts on, like, Tick Tock Shop, Amazon, and then, like, some of them were different brands, but mainly Tick Tock and Amazon because, like, I don't have money to be spending for, like, real stuff. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:58
Okay, got it. For TikTok shop, was this something that you, like where you were scrolling and you saw something? I was like, my friend would really like this and bought it, or did you, like, have it in mind already? 
P
Paige P
43:09
It was like, one of those things where, like, my sister's fiance, I was like, I don't know what the hell to get him. And then she was like, oh, like, he wants, like, this kind of light. So, like, I looked for it and, like, found it, and then that's what I ordered. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:21
Oh, okay. Got it. Okay. Is your default to, like, look for these things on TikTok shop, or do you go on Amazon or, like, you just went through a few different places. 
P
Paige P
43:33
So that she found it on TikTok? So I went on TikTok, but like, half the time I look on Amazon, but then I look at Tick Tock. If it's cheaper with shipping and handling and like, everything like that. But if it's not, then I get it on Amazon. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:44
Oh, okay. Got it. So it wasn't like you were like, scrolling Tick Tock? Yeah, no, it was like, okay, like, I got a link or like, I. No. Okay, this is something I could sort of find on Amazon or Tick Tock. Tick Tock shop was just cheaper, so I just bought it there. Yep. Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. S Cube. It sounds like coffee, but I'm not. 
P
Paige P
44:10
Sure that is a coffee shop. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:12
Yeah, Deli. 
P
Paige P
44:14
This. That was my roommate and I. We got food because we didn't have any time to get back to the room with enough time. So were just like, okay, let's just order ahead and then pick it up. And you Venmo me. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:27
Okay, got it. So it was more like a convenience thing than it was like. 
P
Paige P
44:31
Yeah, like, we didn't plan to be out of the room for, like, six hours. And we're like, oh, we're starving. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:37
Okay, got it. Does that happen often or. Not really. Just, like, once in a while? 
P
Paige P
44:42
Not really. I mean, half the time I'll just hold off on eating until I get home just because I don't want to spend the money. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:47
Yeah, gotcha. And then the rest of the time, do you usually just, like, I guess make your meals or like. 
P
Paige P
44:53
Yeah, that's why, like, my Target orders shipped orders, the fresh market, like, stuff like that. Those are all, like, me buying groceries because I do home cook stuff. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:03
Yeah, that's the shift. I don't know where your shift is. Somewhere here. Okay. 
P
Paige P
45:09
I saw it on the last one. I don't know where it's at. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:12
Yeah, it's. No, that's Doordash. There's. Oh, really? 
P
Paige P
45:18
Because my Target uses shipped people. So, like, it's like one of the two. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:22
Oh, there it is. Yeah, got it. Makes sense. So you, like, shipped and then Amazon fresh or. No. Or something else too. Shipped. 
P
Paige P
45:32
The Fresh market is like some, like, other sort of grocery store. Nash. And then also Target, and then sometimes I'll do, like, Aldi or Walmart or, like, whatever's cheaper. I usually open up, like, four tabs on my computer and, like, see which one's cheaper and, like, which one I should do. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:49
Oh, okay. So you will do, like, comparison shopping for groceries. 
P
Paige P
45:52
Yes, I will. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:54
Yeah, that. That makes sense. And Then like, sounds like based on the food stuff. The food delivery is normally like, I'm went out and I'm hungry. And then the. Some of the restaurants. I guess this restaurant spend. This last one is for, like, convenience. But do you. Do you go out to eat, like, socially as much or. That's more coffee study sessions. 
P
Paige P
46:20
Right now it's more coffee study sessions. I mean, obviously while I've been home, I've been out to eat more. But that's because, like, I'm trying to make plans with people. It's cold out in Jersey, like, what are we going to do outside type of thing. So it's mainly just study sessions. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:34
Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, cool. 
P
Paige P
46:39
Let's see. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:40
We have a couple of minutes left. I don't have to. I mean, is there anything else you want to click here or. I can also just transition to just asking for general kind of thoughts as you were going through this. 
P
Paige P
46:51
I don't think there's really anything else that I would like, click on. I mean, I just go through all of that and then, yeah, especially like the things where I'm like, okay, like, I need to explain myself with this, like the Van Leeuwens. Because I was like, I didn't really want the ice cream, but, like, I got it because, like, my roommate would like it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:08
Yeah, gotcha. That makes sense. I'll stop Shannon's for now. Yeah. Any other, like, thoughts or feedback? 
P
Paige P
47:20
I really don't think so. Like, I like the setup. I like how it's, like, intuitive. I guess it's just like, making sure that, like, the transactions all align. Because, like, you had the problem on your desktop and I had it on my phone too. So like, I. You said that you did, like, a new update. So, like, I guess, like, that's really the only thing that I could say. Like, I don't have much to say about that. I like the custom, like, tab, so I could choose it. Like, I like how there's the magnets and like, the places. I like the way that it talks to you. I do think that it doesn't always need to have like, question after question. But I guess that could be up to the human to be like, oh, like, that's all. 
P
Paige P
47:59
Like, I don't have anything else to say about that. Like, whatever. Or if, like, they say something, there could be like, I guess like the AI bot, it like sends a message and then it like asks you a question if there's like a choice to have like a mult. Like, not a multiple choice, but like, two options being like, yeah, I would like to respond to this, or like, oh, that's all I have to say type of thing. Just so it's not like you don't feel like you need to keep going for them to document the information that you had said into the feed. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:29
Yeah, gotcha. So basically, like, give the human a bit more control over, like, how much more in depth they want to go on a particular topic. Because sometimes, like, there is more, but other times it's like, it's just not that deep. 
P
Paige P
48:41
It's like, this is it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:42
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
48:43
Yes. Like, I like how it's, like, very intuitive and, like, it goes in depth. But, like, in the chat space specifically, I think it needs to be more, like, human controlled and not like, the AI is just like, okay, what else? Like, what do you have to say about this? And, like, stuff like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:58
Okay, got it. Did you feel, like there was, like, sequentially just, like, too many questions one after the other, or. 
P
Paige P
49:06
I mean, I feel like it was just a lot of questions. And, like, I also think that's not, like, it's not really anyone's fault. It's just like, the chat. Like, an AI doesn't really know, like, when a conversation is done unless it's told to be done. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:20
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
49:21
So, like, if it's trying to gather information to put as a magnet, like, it's not going to know. Like, okay, this is all the information I need to, like, put it into each category of red, beige, green, like, whatever it is. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:33
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
49:34
Like, I think, like, having that button would help, like, a human to be able to, like, okay, like, yeah, I'm done. Instead of having to type out, like, I'm done with this conversation, like, that's all you need to know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:41
It's like, cool, this is great. Thanks. 
P
Paige P
49:44
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:45
Like, in a nice way. Not just like, shut up and go away, but, like, yeah, exactly. I'm happy with it. 
P
Paige P
49:50
Yeah. Because it's like, I. I wouldn't want to type like, five times in it, like, in a row, like, okay. Like, that's all I have to say. Like, I'm done with this conversation type of thing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:59
Yeah. Okay, gotcha. So you felt like the conversation sort of hit, like, a natural point of ending, like, after talking with it, like, I don't know, five times. Three. Yeah, three times. So, okay, gotcha. What else? How did you feel about the overall tone of the AI? Like, did you feel like it was, like, things to think about is, like, the. The chattiness level, the, like, friendliness, the like cadence. 
P
Paige P
50:34
It was like a good relationship kind of thing with it. Like, it didn't feel like an AI. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:41
Okay, Cool. And was there anything about the app that was hard to understand or confusing? 
P
Paige P
50:54
I do think that the compose button can give. Like, I don't think many people would understand. Like, if you click compose, it could be more of a general conversation. Yeah. Because myself included, like, I looked at and I was like, what is it mean? Like, what am I composing? Like, a transaction history. Like, I was kind of confused by that, but. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:11
Okay, gotcha. 
P
Paige P
51:12
Besides that, I don't think there really was anything necessarily confusing. I mean, the magnets, it would probably be a instructional, like, way of, like, what. How you get the magnets, like, how you get, like, these landmarks and stuff like that. So, like, I feel like that would be with the app and after it's developed. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:29
Yeah, gotcha. 
P
Paige P
51:35
But I also do think that it would be cool if it did include, like, some sort of budgeting thing as well. Like I said earlier. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:42
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
51:45
Sorry, I may have repeated myself. I just want to make sure you have all your data that you need to have. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:49
Yeah, yeah, no, it's good. It's also helpful to know what you also remembered on what you said. So it's like, this is the stuff that's important. Yeah, no, that's. That's a good feedback. We'll think about how to do it because we also know that, like, budgeting in its traditional sense, when it's like month level, a bunch of numbers, like, it can be really stressful for some people. And, like, that's what we're trying to, like, avoid. But I also think there's probably some room to do it in a way that is helpful but not overwhelming for people. 
P
Paige P
52:20
Like, my idea, if I may, will be like, you know how there's like, the menu buttons in certain apps? Like, maybe if it was like a menu thing and there was like a budgeting, like, separate category, like, for budgeting. So it's like, it's up to the discretion of the user to want to do it. Like, they don't feel pressured by anyone besides themselves to want to do it. Okay. Like, that's just my idea, obviously. Like, you don't have to take it and run with it. But, like, that's just like, for me, like, I would be like, oh, okay. Like, I don't have a robot telling me, like, you need to start budgeting right now. Like, it's more like, yeah, if I'm looking at my numbers on the one tab and like, I switch over and it's like, oh, budget. 
P
Paige P
52:58
Like, it's like, okay, maybe I should try and do that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:01
Got it, got it. So you would use the budget tool in some way if it were in the app? 
P
Paige P
53:10
Yes. Because, like, I would like to know, like, all right, what do you think? And I would want it to be reasonable amounts, which I think an AI is better than a human to be like, okay, well, if you're meal prepping, like X amount of days, it would be reasonable to have a budget set for like the month for groceries to be this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:28
Yeah. Okay. 
P
Paige P
53:31
Or like, how do you think of like, this amount to be budgeting for this month? Like, even if it takes into account, like, gas money, I mean, like, gas prices have been going up. Like, okay, like, it makes sense. Like, if you're like looking at like, how much you've been spending on gas, like, gas prices are going to go up. So just expect to pay X amount more. Blah, blah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:50
Gotcha, gotcha. And then let's say, like we do this. Like, it's like almost like a, like bottom up budgeting. It's almost like asking you, like, what your lifestyle is and then like estimating, let's say, like, it goes through that exercise. How would you like to see it? Right, because it's something to. Or do you want it to just know it's in there and when you ask questions, it will pull up your budget? 
P
Paige P
54:15
I would like that. Where it's like, if I ask questions or even if it's in that tab for like budgeting. Like, if it were just like a diagram and just be like, I mean, or maybe like the pictures, you know how y' all have like the pictures, like the landmarks and whatnot and like the different, like, heart and everything. Like, if you were to click onto like one of those emojis and like it pops up like a sticky note on your phone. Okay. And it could just be like it could be like the size of like the square on my phone. Like, it's like a square probably like a third or a fourth. Fourth of. No, like, yeah, a fifth of the screen that I have on my phone. 
P
Paige P
54:48
And it's like I could see it and like, it's there and it's visual. Like, visual for me to, like, know and. Yeah, like, you just. I don't know. I like the visual aspects with stuff. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:59
Okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. I was just thinking of something even, like, silly like, oh, if you have like a budget area, let's say like Taco Bell, you Have, like, your actual spend is like a size, and then it's like you're dotted. There's a dotted line taco. That's your budget. So you can see how much your taco is of that. 
P
Paige P
55:19
That is a. I like that wacky idea. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:21
But it's like that because then it's. 
P
Paige P
55:23
Like, all right, you're like this amount, but you have, like, this amount to get to the budget. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:27
Yeah. And then you're like, oh, if you overspend their budget, you're like, wow, that's a lot of tacos. That. 
P
Paige P
55:33
Yeah, I like that. I do like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:35
Okay, I'll keep that in mind. How to visually. But basically, like, some soft way to have AI help guide step by step in an easy way based on habits. Setting, like, some kind of budget and then visually displaying it in a way that is, like, easy to grasp with the icons or whatever. Could be something interesting. 
P
Paige P
55:54
Yes, I do like that. That's cute. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:58
We'll think of that. Anything else top of mind for you? I know we're like, a minute over, but anything, like, any last question thoughts? 
P
Paige P
56:06
I. I can't think of anything as, like, I think I said my piece. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:10
Okay. No, this. You said a lot, so just wanted to give you the chance. But thank you so much, Paige, for staying on. I know it's late your time, so really appreciate it. Of course. So this concludes the study, so we'll make sure to process the gift card and everything for your time. And we're, . If we have anything else in the future to test with you or get your feedback on, we'll, like, reach out. But just want to say thank you for your time and. Yeah, this was fun. 
P
Paige P
56:43
No, of course. I look forward to seeing, like, how the app develops throughout, like, this time. And I appreciate y' all for using me. Thank you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:51
Of course. Thanks, Paige. 
P
Paige P
56:53
Thank you, Sherry. Have a great rest of your night. Or day. I don't know what time period it is right now. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:58
It's all good. 
P
Paige P
56:59
It's all good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:00
All right, see you. 
P
Paige P
57:02
Bye. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:02
Bye.
