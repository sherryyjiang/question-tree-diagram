Hi, Malik. 
M
MxL
04:21
Hi, Sherry. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:22
How are you? I'm doing well. Where are you dialing in from? 
M
MxL
04:26
Los Angeles. I'm sorry for the lag. I couldn't find our email on my MacBook. Everything was on my phone and I thought it would join like this instead. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:35
Oh, yeah, no problem at all. Let's. Let me give you a little bit of background on things and would love to just jump into it. So I'm Sheri doing research for a company called Peak and we're doing a little bit of concept testing on our app and would love to get your feedback. So how this will work is the first part will just be questions to get to know a bit more about your background, relationship with money, things like that. And then the second part, we're going to show you some concepts around the app and the goal is for you to be as honest as possible. Just like pretend you have a microphone to your head and you're just like stream of consciousness saying whatever is out loud. Pretend I'm not even there. 
M
MxL
05:14
Just to. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:15
Yeah. Get your. 
M
MxL
05:15
Get your thoughts. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:18
Wanted to check two things really quickly before getting started. One is, are you okay with us recording this call for learning purposes? Yeah. And number two is, are you okay with connecting, downloading and connecting your bank account to the app to show I. 
M
MxL
05:32
Have it all done? I've had the app all connected and set up since the 23rd of November. 
M
MxL
05:39
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:40
Yeah. 
M
MxL
05:41
All right, cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:42
Then you're already set, so let's just dive in. We'd love to hear. Hear a little bit more about your background. So you live in Los Angeles, but what's your age? When did you graduate and what are you up to right now? 
M
MxL
05:57
Well, I'm 22. I'm actually turning 23 tomorrow from LA. Early birthday. Thank you. Graduated this June from UCLA with my bachelor's in psychology. Currently taking a gap year to gain some experience, to have time to rest and, you know, all the good stuff. 
M
MxL
06:21
What else? 
M
MxL
06:23
I don't know if hobbies. Hobbies are relevant. I write poetry. I love making candles. I'm an influencer on the side. Not full time just yet. I had a lot of academic priorities, so to step away from that for a bit, but. 
M
MxL
06:40
Yeah. 
M
MxL
06:40
And I'm a Palm mom of two. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:43
You're a proud mom. 
M
MxL
06:46
Oh. 
M
MxL
06:46
Oh, Pomeranian. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:48
Oh, pomp. I thought you said proud mom. 
M
MxL
06:51
No, nothing I don't like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:52
Yeah. 
M
MxL
06:55
Oh, good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:55
Oh, that's so cute. I. I love pets. That's adorable. Yeah. Well, thank you. And I'm wondering, you know, when it comes to. I Guess money. Right. Like, how are you? Tell me what you do today. Like, to make sure, like, things are in check. 
M
MxL
07:19
I try to shop during sales. That's something big. I'm a huge shopaholic, which, I mean, based on the app, I clearly have certain days. I shop at certain places, which I had no idea that I do. That was really helpful. So, yeah, I shop during sales. I try to see, like, if I accomplish something that is worth rewarding myself with. So I kind of have that reward system set up for me, which is, like, kind of keeps me in check from overspending. I'm like, okay, well, I did something that I'm proud of today, so maybe I'll spend 25 on XYZ or whatever. So I kind of go off with that mindset with me spending. 
M
MxL
08:02
What else do I do? 
M
MxL
08:05
And. I someone who likes to try out, like, a lot of beauty stuff. So I might, like, buy, like, maybe five things and then end up keeping maybe two. So even though it kind of looks like I'm overspending, on the surface, I'm really just keeping half of what I purchased. And I guess that for me is kind of like me budgeting and still getting something that I really want. And I get to try a new product, which makes me pretty happy. So that's basically what I go off of. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:39
Yeah. When you say you buy five things and keep to, basically you return the other three. 
M
MxL
08:44
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:45
Got it. 
M
MxL
08:45
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:47
Makes. Makes sense. 
M
MxL
08:48
A lot of the products I buy, you know, beauty products are subjective. Not everything you see is going to look exactly as you pictured, especially with fragrance. 
M
MxL
08:56
So, you know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:59
Yeah. So basically it's a go. Go on. 
M
MxL
09:03
I guess. One other thing. I personally prefer shopping online instead of in person. I don't know if that makes that big of a difference. Like, if I'm outside, I noticed that I really don't want to spend when I'm outside unless it's like, you know, for food or whatever. But, like, actual shopping, I don't really want to, like, spend. But when I'm at home or, like, whatever I'm shopping online, I go with my, like, regular shopping habits and my little spending rules. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:31
Yeah, what. What makes you not like, shopping outside as much? I'm just curious. 
M
MxL
09:38
I don't know. It's kind of like, psychologically like a different experience. I feel like I'm spending more. 
M
MxL
09:43
Like, once I see, like, a physical cart in my hand and I see how many items are actually going inside, it feels like, more real to me. 
M
MxL
09:52
And I'm like, well, okay, I Don't. 
M
MxL
09:53
Want to spend this much. I think I can hold out or I can wait until like, there's a sale online. And another thing, I guess me just shopping online gives me more excitement. I'm really excited about, like, shipments and packages coming in. So that's another big aspect for me. Anticipating when your packages and stuff are coming instead of just purchasing in store. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:16
Got it. So there's a bit of this, like, surprise. Yeah, got it. Does it have anything to do with, like, the convenience of it or you think that's like, secondary to, like. I just prefer to, like, you know, click around and then have a little surprise come? 
M
MxL
10:35
Maybe a bit of both. I don't know. But yeah, for years now, I noticed that I really don't like shopping in person. Really? Really? 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:45
Yeah, yeah. 
M
MxL
10:47
Food and like, nothing else. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:50
Got it, got it. And besides, like, shopping, right, like, what are the other, like, I guess, categories of importance for you that you think about or are a bit more aware of than the others? 
M
MxL
11:09
Well, for me, mostly bills and shopping are the most priority. So I make sure I have like, my bills on time and everything. I keep enough money to pay my bills. I'm never late for a payment, so I'm like, okay, if I shop this much, then I'm not gonna have enough money to pay my bills, so I really need tone it down or whatever. But yeah, mostly those shopping consists of, like, not only stuff that I want. I buy stuff for family, my pets and. Yeah, so, yeah, all around. 
M
MxL
11:40
Yeah, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:41
And when you say bills, like, what kind of bills are these? 
M
MxL
11:47
Credit card bills, phone bill. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:51
Got. So like, essentials, essentially. 
M
MxL
11:53
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:54
Okay, got it. 
M
MxL
11:55
And. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:57
One question out of curiosity, right? Like you mentioned, you do a lot of online shopping. I'm guessing receipts will go to your email, correct? If there was a possibility of connecting your email to Peak so that it actually pulls up the exact receipts, let's say you spent at Sephora or wherever. Would you be willing to connect your Gmail for that or that's not important. 
M
MxL
12:24
I would, but I would like, if I were to do that, I would like kind of do you know the Fetch app? 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:30
I have not used it, but go on. Yeah. 
M
MxL
12:33
So I would love if Peak had something like that, kind of like a reward system for like your shopping and like your receipts or whatever point, collecting points. That was something I wanted to bring up. So if it had that, I would love to do that with the receipts because I do that for Fetch. It's connected to my Amazon, but, you know, whatever receipts I Find around the house. 
M
MxL
12:56
I'll scan. 
M
MxL
12:57
But the only thing I don't like about Fetch is that, you know, you can't connect it to like different retailers or whatever. It's not going to get any other receipt automatically other than Amazon. So if Pete had that feature, I would love to do that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:14
Yeah, got it. What percentage of your receipts do you think go to your email then? 
M
MxL
13:26
Maybe like 50%. Okay. All right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:31
I guess the rest would just be within the apps themselves, right? Okay, I guess. Okay, that's helpful to know. And what I have one, I guess final question, just on general background, we have two. What do you think you would like to be able to tell Peak that Pete doesn't know today? That can guide you better. 
M
MxL
14:05
If you give me a second. I kind of need to look at that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:08
Yeah, yeah, it's okay. 
M
MxL
14:13
I mean so far all I know is that I'm loving that it sends me notifications and it's like, okay, well you spent like 200 something dollars in Macy's which is equivalent to. It said something like three weeks of buying coffee or whatever and I was like, okay. I didn't know that there was something. 
M
MxL
14:32
It said the other day. 
M
MxL
14:34
It was like a. Not the daily vibe check. It was kind of like a spending analysis or whatever. I thought that wasn't too accurate. Another thing I didn't love as much is that I would want Peak to only look at like the most recent purchases, like maybe within the last month or so. Think statement type. Like you know, when you pay your bills you see the statement for the month. So as I was like setting up the app, it kept bringing up like other months. So initially as I was like trying to get used to that was a bit messy for me. I didn't really like that. So I would love to tell like Peak to set up everything according to like how bills work with like you see everything within a month accurately. 
M
MxL
15:20
Then it could be like, well, you spent this much which could equal to you. I don't know again like the coffee example that I brought up. So I would want something like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:31
Yeah, got it. Do you remember what the spending analysis was, by the way? We can totally jump into the app in a minute if that's help more helpful because I do have a few more like non app questions. 
M
MxL
15:43
Questions. 
M
MxL
15:45
I don't remember what the analysis was, but I was like, it's not that accurate. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:50
Okay, cool, no worries. Okay, two more questions. What do you, I guess what have you been using to like check your finances? You like use Your banking app and, like, open it. 
M
MxL
16:07
That's it. Yeah, Open like, maybe twice or three times a week. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:11
Yeah, yeah. 
M
MxL
16:13
So I'm like, I spent this much. These are being returned. Let me see if this went back to the account. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:19
Yeah, yeah. 
M
MxL
16:21
But no other, like, actual budgeting apps. I've never used anything like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:25
Yeah. If there was a better way to track your returns in an app, like, hey, you bought this, but we noticed there was a charge back to the same merchant. You completed the return, like, would that be helpful at all? 
M
MxL
16:41
You mean like, the app saying, like, the return stuff was already complete? 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:46
Yes. Like, hey, like, your return. 
M
MxL
16:50
Yeah, yeah. Because I. Your refund hit and checking. I would love if, like, there was an app for that. And like, you get notifications because doing it manually, like, the returns and stuff mixed with the purchases, so takes a bit of time to pick around and find what actually went back to your account. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:07
Yeah. 
M
MxL
17:08
Or like, I would go as far as to say, like, if the app could even say, like, the merchant left a note or something, like the return is being delayed or like, there's issues with the return or whatever. So that would also be helpful if all of this was in one app or a part of just one general app. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:26
Yeah, got it. And what do you. What would you say? Like, gives you anxiety about money or, like, think back the last time you felt anxious, like, what was it? 
M
MxL
17:47
I guess just. Feeling really up for shopping emotionally, and then just looking at how much is being spent and you're like, well, I need to stop. But you, like, continue to shop and you just see, like, the number is going down on your account and, like, your bill is getting higher. So that might be the only thing. I don't know if there's anything else. 
M
MxL
18:10
For me at least. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:12
So basically having a bit more of a control on the shopping stuff. Okay, I said I had two more questions. I just have one more. Do you currently live alone or do you have roommates? Or, like, how do you do the bills? Basically. 
M
MxL
18:28
I live with family, but the specific bills that I mentioned, I pay myself. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:32
Okay, got it. No, that's helpful. I asked because sometimes people do, like, bill splitting with, like, I don't know, a boyfriend or, like, a roommates. Okay. All right, let's then go into the concept part. Since you already have used the app, I think you should be. 
M
MxL
18:53
You sound like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:54
Sounds like you're relatively familiar. So if you can show me, like, how you're using it by presenting it, that would be great. What you can do is you can go into the calendar for our meeting and click join and then present from your phone. 
M
MxL
19:24
So. 
M
MxL
19:26
Yeah, it's okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:28
Yeah. So this is the talent. So you go, no worries. So you'll see, like calendar invite. You click on it, opens up this meeting. Take your time. I can help guide you through. No stress. 
M
MxL
20:03
I don't use the calendar stuff. I have no idea. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:05
It's not very. I know. 
M
MxL
20:06
It's very intuitive. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:08
Yeah. 
M
MxL
20:11
Okay. 
M
MxL
20:11
Oh, this event isn't in your calendar. Hold on. Guess you have to add it in. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:18
So actually. 
M
MxL
20:21
Let'S see how. 
M
MxL
20:23
Because here I see the meeting link. Join by phone. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:27
Yeah, join by phone. And then really important, make sure to turn your volume all the way down on your phone, like, all the way down. And then mute the meeting. Otherwise there's a weird echo. 
M
MxL
20:39
Okay. Are you supposed to call this number? 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:47
You're supposed to dial in. Yeah, let me try to unmask my. Hold one second. Okay, so you basically go here, you join this meet link. You see this? 
M
MxL
21:05
Oh, yeah. Okay. 
M
MxL
21:09
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:10
Let me know when you're on the screen. 
M
MxL
21:21
One sec. As to join. 
M
MxL
21:34
Okay. Okay. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:39
Turn the volume all the way down. 
M
MxL
21:40
Yeah, yeah. Like. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:42
Okay. So then now you can click on this, like, share screen button. 
M
MxL
21:48
This is the top. This button here. I actually do not see it at the top. 
M
MxL
22:06
Oh. 
M
MxL
22:08
Huh. What's happening here? Hold on. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:11
No, no, it's okay. 
M
MxL
22:15
Is it like tools? 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:18
It should be here. Do you see this screen at all? No. Oh, what do you see? Let me see. Show me your phone, actually. 
M
MxL
22:29
Oh, not the. 
M
MxL
22:30
Clear. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:33
Okay, try to click on the three dots. 
M
MxL
22:36
The three. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:37
There's a three vertical dots. 
M
MxL
22:39
Yeah, show me what you see there. Oh, Sherry screen. Okay. It was this one. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:43
Okay, there it is. Yeah, it. It must have just. 
M
MxL
22:48
Okay, how do you like. Why is it trying to, like, only show Gmail 1 second. Screen broadcast is only showing Gmail even. 
M
MxL
23:08
Though the peak app is open. 
M
MxL
23:09
So I don't know if I can. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:10
Oh, you supposed to click on. 
M
MxL
23:14
Well, let's see here. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:19
So it says Gmail, but you can say start broadcast because your first app is. So you can see this, right? This is what it's supposed to look like. So just say start broadcast. 
M
MxL
23:33
Okay. Does it show? 
M
MxL
23:38
Okay. Okay, There we go. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:39
Oh, yes. Yay. 
M
MxL
23:40
Okay, cool. 
M
MxL
23:40
We're good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:43
Yeah, don't. Don't even sweat about it. Yeah, just like, pretend I'm not here. Like, just like scroll through the app and just like start, like saying whatever comes to your mind. Just like, react to it and then I'll. 
M
MxL
23:55
I'll. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:55
Like ask questions like throughout if it comes up or some at the end. 
M
MxL
24:00
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:01
Yeah, yeah, just like start from the top and then. 
M
MxL
24:04
Yeah, go ahead. I could have sworn I saw more. 
M
MxL
25:59
Stuff on the app the other day than it is right now. I felt like I was scrolling more and looking at more. Like there was obviously the streak at the top connecting like different bank accounts or whatever than the peak aura. But I could have sworn I saw something else the last two days that I was looking, but. 
M
MxL
26:21
So far pretty happy with everything. 
M
MxL
26:30
One thing I like is that it notes the zero spend days because sometimes to me when I go shopping, like I give a lot of thought before I go shopping. Then once I finally do, I don't realize like how many days in a row I'm actually spending. So I really like this top section of the app and then it like telling me the patterns. But other than that I just look at the streak. This why you got this aura section? Occasionally a bit of this, but I don't really use that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:08
And you scroll back up which one you say don't use this one. Right? 
M
MxL
27:14
Yeah, I don't really use this. I think at least for me, this top part is more helpful like this like 38 points, 6 points, 12 points. So that to me is more helpful than probably this. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:30
Is it because it just feels like it's just a list of transactions. 
M
MxL
27:35
Yeah. Bit repetitive, at least for me because I know in each app how much I'm spending and like what I'll be keeping. But one thing I don't know is whether this app shows like the returns. Like when you finally do it. I only saw like the total transactions. Like if I were to spend 30 and then, you know, like I said, I buy like a few items, then I keep half, return the half. I don't know if that shows in this app. Does it? I haven't seen anything like that. I only see like the total amount. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:08
Yeah, not yet. 
M
MxL
28:10
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:11
But that's something you would like to be able to see. 
M
MxL
28:13
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:14
Okay. Got it. And the reason why you like the zero spend day tracking stuff is. Is it because it's, I guess, harder to see that in your banking app. 
M
MxL
28:25
Yeah. And I also have notifications and stuff on this app. I have a daily reminder, let's see it here. But I get reminders, which I mean again, it was like the three week coffee thing. So that itself was helpful just seeing it as a notification, not like an actual section on the app. Because I treated it more like that point system section. Like this aura Section. But yeah, whatever just kind of simplifies stuff for me instead of me manually going through everything on the bank account is more convenient. 
M
MxL
29:04
Yeah, I don't know if there is anything else that I look for. 
M
MxL
29:08
I meant really connected other apps. I don't know what the rules and categories stuff are just yet. I haven't looked at those. 
M
MxL
29:19
And yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:25
got it. And what made what stood out about the. Hey, spending at Macy's is like three weeks of buying coffee. You mentioned that as a notification. 
M
MxL
29:37
Yeah, notifications will come like multiple times during the day. Usually I hate notifications, but I surprisingly don't mind this one. It kind of gives me an idea like what I could have spent my money on. Like, you know, you could just be spending a hundred dollars on clothes, but you could also be spending a hundred dollars on xyz. And that to me is pretty thought provoking and gives me ideas for how to like split up money into like getting multiple things instead of just one thing, which is something I like to do. I never like to buy just one thing. I like. If I have a hundred dollars, I'll split the hundred into you know, 25 on this, 25 on that or whatever so I can get like a bit of everything. 
M
MxL
30:24
So that kind of reminded me of my own like spending habits, which was pretty nice. But yeah, I really like that feature of that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:35
Got it. If there was a option, let's say to show like. 
M
MxL
30:45
Hey, oh my God. 
M
MxL
30:48
I did not disconnect my screen. So sorry. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:54
Yeah, yeah, it's all good. 
M
MxL
30:55
Yeah, go ahead. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:56
If you like had an option to share and with peak and I guess learn with yourself as well. Like hey, would you prefer to spend a hundred dollars on these things or a hundred dollars on these things and you got to pick and Pete kind of remembers that, like would that be helpful for you so that way you like understand the trade offs a bit more. 
M

31:24
I guess. One other thing I would really like, considering that at least this app was advertised more towards Gen Z and based on like stuff I've observed and myself, I would love if the app kind of has like a point system eventually in the future. I know like the app is just starting out, but I think that would be like really helpful. Like, oh, you're the app could be like, oh, you're spending habits have improved. So here's an X amount of points. You can redeem it for whatever. I don't know. I know there's like a premium version of the app so that could potentially be enough. But like you know, kind of how fetch operates, at least with the receipts. But I think having something like that in the app could be nice and kind of draw more traffic to that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:13
Makes sense. 
M
MxL
32:14
Makes sense. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:17
And if you had to say your like favorite thing around these apps so far, like what would it be? 
M
MxL
32:35
I guess that it mentions spending patterns. That was one of the things that I noticed the other day was like, oh, on Thursday and Sunday nights you shop at, I don't know, like Amazon. And I had no idea that I did that. So that was something I really like. But ultimately it's like this aura section of the app. I feel like that for me is the most helpful. It says that talks about like your patterns when you don't shop and really keeps track of like how many days during the week or I don't know if it calculates like the times and stuff, at least evenings or whatever. But I really like that section of the app the most. And the notifications and stuff aren't buggy, so I guess that's another plus for me considering I turn off the notifications for almost everything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:33
Yeah, makes sense. Anything else? 
M
MxL
33:37
Top of mind? No, I think I said everything I thought about. No, all good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:46
And then tell me your least favorite things. Just like, oh, I don't know, this doesn't make sense. I don't like it didn't make me feel. Why did, why did they build this? 
M
MxL
33:58
Be honest. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:59
Yeah. 
M
MxL
34:08
To be honest, I don't like. I mean, I don't hate it. 
M
MxL
34:11
I just don't really get like the. 
M
MxL
34:12
Streak section considering like there is no like point system or whatever going on. So I don't care about that. I mean every app I use that has like a streak pattern thing going on where it tracks how many times you go in the app during the week or whatever has some kind of point system. So to me the streak thing isn't really doing it. I don't know if like the premium version of the app has like better features, but so far I'm content with these. I just don't really care about like the streak part. I like that you can talk to the AI thing within the app like I was doing earlier and like you can kind of customize it to like it's tone, I guess, being more harsh on your spending habits or whatever. 
M
MxL
34:55
I really like that it kind of reminded me of like this like the budget version of Chat GPT instead, except it's gonna treat you more like an actual person and talk about like, oh, you need to like calm it down with spending this much during this week or whatever. But yeah, I really like that feature. And just the aura section. Don't really care about the streaks. I don't know how I feel about the daily vibe. I don't care for it as much. I. I'm okay with this section, the high, like the spending alert. So that's fine. 
M
MxL
35:32
I mean. 
M
MxL
35:34
Yeah, I don't think there's anything else that I would be unhappy about. 
M
MxL
35:39
I think it's pretty clear. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:43
And on the part about this streaks, Right. When you said that it would better with a point system, is it just the fact that it has points that you can work towards or do you want it to be points that you can basically redeem for some kind of economic value in the future? 
M
MxL
36:00
Yeah, kind of like something with value. Okay. Every single app I've used kind of works like that. So that's what I'm used to. And it, for me at least it's more motivating to open an app and start engaging with it when I know, like, there is something I can get out of it. I mean, I do love that, you know, it helps you spend better and notes your patterns and whatever, but I would still like some kind of like, reward value situation going on with that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:30
Got it, Got it. And then how would you feel if the aura score at the top was a, like a profile completion score, which is like, how well Peak knows you based on the information that you're giving Peak to help you understand and act on your spending patterns better? 
M
MxL
36:57
I guess I wouldn't feel as. 
M
MxL
36:58
Different because what I felt was like, Peak didn't really take the time to get to know me since, like, it's not really like, you know those AI apps where you talk to the AI bot and it customizes itself according to you. It just, you know, it connects to like, Pete connects to your bank account. It gets like all of like your spending stuff and it just forms an idea about you. I mean, other than like the AI bought earlier, which I was looking at, that was like, oh, you spent 400 or whatever. But I don't know, I. I guess I wouldn't feel pretty different with the OR thing changing. I'm okay with how it is. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:36
Yeah. Would you like Pete to spend a bit more time to get to know you and ask questions before it spits out some of these insights? Or do you like having it start with like these insights and then you chat with it? 
M
MxL
37:49
I would love if, like, at least when the profile was being created for it to ask a bit of questions about you. So you could have that in mind, then look at like the bank account stuff and then just go from there and still have like the regular setup. But yeah, so that's the only change I would like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:09
Okay, got it. Did you have any things that you thought could have been better about the AI chat as you were using it? What did you like or didn't like? Yeah, let me actually pull that up. 
M
MxL
38:27
My phone keeps exiting the. The screen for some reason. 
M
MxL
38:38
Oh, where even was the AI bot thing? I don't even know how I found it. 
M
MxL
38:47
Oh, here. 
M
MxL
38:58
I guess I'm kind of happy that you know it. 
M
MxL
39:01
As soon as you connect, it starts. 
M
MxL
39:05
Talking about like your pace and everything. 
M
MxL
39:07
It gives you like sample responses to spec to send and like ask questions and do like deep dives or whatever and that you're still able to talk to it as normal. Like you're not really stuck with like these three options down here. So I guess that's something I really like with. This is the first time during this call that I'm actually trying out the AI thing. So at least at first glance, that's all I can say about this so far. But I really like that, you know, this is in there, like, you can chat. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:39
Yeah. So you like the. 
M
MxL
39:41
I. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:41
You like that there's options that you can click on to make it. 
M
MxL
39:44
Yeah, like, yeah. Because, I mean, sometimes when you read something, you might not immediately have an idea of what you want to say. So it kind of gives you a. A few samples of what you can ask to actually get like proper information. And then from there, if you're happy with the options, you can use them. If not, you can still talk to it as normal. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:08
Gotcha. And if you had a option of having more of a, I guess, visual or image instead of just text for the chat, would you prefer that or do you like that it's like more conversational and text based? 
M
MxL
40:25
I actually like how it is right now. I'm loving how conversational it is. 
M
MxL
40:29
I don't really care much for pictures. I feel like it would get too messy. I think this is following, you know, the OpenAI style, which I actually like. So I'm pretty content with just this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:43
Gotcha. Okay, and final question on this before I show you the last concept. How was the navigation of the app? Like, did you feel like it was like confusing to know which sections mean what, or did you feel like it was pretty straightforward to just scroll through? 
M
MxL
41:03
I think it was pretty straightforward, actually. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:07
Okay. 
M
MxL
41:15
Yeah, I think everything is set up pretty Nicely. 
M
MxL
41:19
One thing I do like is that, like this unlock Peak premium thing, unlike other apps, it doesn't keep, like, popping up on your screen every time you open the app. I like that, you know, it has its own little section on the side. It's not interrupting. Interrupting your app use. So I really like the basic setup of the app itself, but. 
M
MxL
41:41
Yeah, awesome. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:44
Okay, I'm gonna have you now look at a different concept. The it's going to be a web site, mobile web page instead of a downloadable app. I just sent you in the chat, the link to it. Actually, it's better if you open this one on the browser, like the laptop browser. You see Preview Peak money. I sent it in the. 
M
MxL
42:13
Yeah, yeah. 
M
MxL
42:18
I can open that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:19
Yeah. So if you can actually present now your laptop and then go to this prototype that I just sent you. 
M
MxL
42:31
Should I exit the call from my phone? 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:33
Oh, yeah, that. Okay. 
M
MxL
42:35
Yeah, perfect. Does it show? 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:04
Yeah, I can see it. I think if you click sign in and use the same email as Peak, it should work. Otherwise you have to go to sign up. Okay, perfect. Yeah, just. You can just. It's a bit wide, but it's supposed to be on, like, a mobile screen. So just imagine it was, like, squished a little bit more. But yeah, go ahead and just, like, do the same thing and just like. Actually, one thing you can do is if you just, like, squish your screen, I think on your actual, like, Chrome window, it should look smaller and easier. 
M
MxL
43:56
Oh, I'm on safari. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:58
Oh, okay. Safari works just like. Just make the screen a bit small. Like you kind of. 
M
MxL
44:14
Okay, that's. 
M
MxL
44:14
I don't know if it. No, it gets bigger, but. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:18
Oh, yeah, just take the corner of the window, like, here. Yeah. And just, like, move it to the. If it's on the left side, just move it to the right. 
M
MxL
44:33
It's not doing anything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:34
Yeah. If it doesn't do it's okay. I just thought it is. Visually, it's a bit, like, bloated, but it's fine. 
M
MxL
44:41
Actually, I kind of like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:42
It's pretty big. 
M
MxL
44:43
Surprisingly. 
M
MxL
44:45
Okay, it's a bit fine, but whatever. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:47
Yeah. I mean, as long as you can see everything. That's just. Yeah, like, imagine it's on the phone. Actually, just go back. It's totally fine. 
M
MxL
44:57
That's fine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:58
Yeah. I don't see your screen anymore, though. Or on the. 
M
MxL
45:04
Oh, is okay. Pause for Google. It says showing. Hold on. Where is that? I have no idea what's going on with this. Stop sharing. Wait, what would happen if I close this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:35
Okay. 
M
MxL
45:37
Is anything still showing or. 
M
MxL
45:40
No. 
M
MxL
45:42
Oh, wait. 
M
MxL
45:42
Why did it exit? 
M
MxL
45:44
I know what's going on with this. I'm gonna try going back on the website again to see if that works. 
M
MxL
45:55
Because I don't know what was going on with that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:00
Okay. 
M
MxL
46:03
And. 
M
MxL
46:06
Share screen. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:14
Right. 
M
MxL
46:15
Not this window. 
M
MxL
46:17
Does anything show here? 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:19
Yeah, I can see it now. 
M
MxL
46:20
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:21
Yeah, go ahead. And just like, same drill as before. Just like look around, like react to it. By the way, some of the stuff will say zero because it's the first of the month, so it makes sense. Yeah. And it's a funny day to be testing this, but normally there'll be stuff there. 
M
MxL
46:54
I'm really curious about this prediction section. 
M
MxL
46:56
I thought it was completely something else. 
M
MxL
47:00
Let's see right here. 
M
MxL
47:05
I know mine is probably going to fill up in this section pretty quickly. Okay, I see this spendy day section is the thing I was talking about earlier. That's the part that I really like. I had no idea I spent the most on these days. So that's something else that I really like for me at least from here I completely stopped with food delivery, so that part would be irrelevant for me. Same with rideshare. So the only thing I would be using is probably like this online shopping section and probably predictions and maybe like this insight section. 
M
MxL
48:05
Yeah. 
M
MxL
48:06
But those other two things, probably not. The fun zone. I think I was doing this bit, the getting roasted thing. That was pretty new. I never seen anything like that. So despite like spending only two minutes on it was pretty interesting. I think I'll engage more with that. I think I did the money personality thing the other day. That's what I was saying wasn't the most accurate, but yeah, so that's my thoughts at first glance. Oh, and I do like the daily average section. And the subscription. I know it's not probably going to fill up as much because I try not to really get sucked into the subscription type of things other than like streaming services. Maybe like one or two. 
M
MxL
49:10
But yeah. 
M
MxL
49:12
So. At least my. On my end, this bit would be pretty clean. Minus the online shopping section. 
M
MxL
49:26
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:31
Got it. Is there anything else that I guess your eyes would be drawn to click around or like this is kind of like as far as you would kind of look at things. 
M
MxL
49:44
You know. 
M
MxL
49:44
I was initially really drawn to this prediction section. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:48
Yeah. 
M
MxL
49:48
But in my head, the prediction section was not what I thought it was going to be. 
M
MxL
49:55
Okay, what did you. 
M
MxL
49:57
It was gonna be like, based on, like the patterns it saw. Like, you know, like Macy's was a Retailer I shop at pretty frequently. So it'd be like, I predict that next week you're gonna shop at Macy's twice. Maybe you're gonna shop on Tuesday and Friday or whatever. I was thinking it's gonna be something like that. So that's the idea I had in my head, at least for this section. But I was immediately drawn to this like, little bit more than anything else. 
M
MxL
50:26
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:29
Got it. It was it also like the visual part of it? 
M
MxL
50:35
I don't know, I think it's like. 
M
MxL
50:36
This little oracle thing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:38
Yeah, yeah, got it. So you would like it if it were like, hey, like it just kind of understands and reads your patterns and then like tells you like, hey, you're likely to do this next week based on. 
M
MxL
50:51
Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought I was gonna say. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:54
Yeah, yeah. 
M
MxL
50:56
Okay. 
M
MxL
50:59
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:03
I'm gonna have you now. Actually go back to the app. I'm gonna have you go to Insights and then like click around the orange buttons and then just like, let me know what you think. Maybe click on the month one because I think there's just nothing. Maybe it's just not populating. So weird. 
M
MxL
51:43
Okay, well, no, I, I think the weekly thing, like this money flow thing the app has, I actually like, I was talking about it with my mom, I was like, see, I spent this much. This much is going back on my card or whatever. I like that. I mean we, me and her often do this manually. So I really like this feature on the app and I was thinking of putting her on but maybe after like these ideas are taken into consideration. She's pretty picky about like apps and stuff that she uses, especially about budgeting. She likes to do everything manually. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:21
Yeah. 
M
MxL
52:26
Let's see. 
M
MxL
52:48
I really like this section. I think it's really neatly set up and easy to navigate and. But the thing I'm not sure is again, I would like to only see transactions at max, like within like the two month frame instead of like I saw that it dated transactions all the way back to June, which I don't really care about. And it's the moment I bought the app and like it was getting everything from my statements or whatever that was kind of confusing. I was like, why am I seeing stuff from the past that I forget to pay this or whatever. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:24
So. 
M
MxL
53:24
So that anything past maybe two months or max three, if we're really pushing it is irrelevant, at least to me. 
M
MxL
53:34
So that's another thing I wanted to know. 
M
MxL
53:41
Spendy days. I'm really happy with this bit. Daily average is pretty useful to get an idea of how much is being spent. So I really like this section. Maybe some other things could be added to the fun zone. I don't know, maybe like a game or something. I don't really know. Again, but that would probably be the most helpful with, like, the point system. But I'm pretty content with this money personality and getting roasted. But it's pretty unique. I never seen anything like that. 
M
MxL
54:16
Is there anything else here? No. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:19
Let me. Actually, I want to show you my screen to just show you what the data and the orange looks like, just because it's hard to visualize without it. But this is what it should look like. So in and out. Yikes. I mean, this is like. And then, like, you have a map here. 
M
MxL
54:46
What's the map for this one specifically, how many days? 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:51
Yeah. 
M
MxL
54:52
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:54
So, like, which days look more spendy? I mean, these are a bunch of numbers. I know. See what else? Yeah, that's what's in there. Would you find that useful or, like, not really. 
M
MxL
55:18
Yeah. The only thing to me that was confusing was just the thing that I just noted. Because, I mean, I'm assuming, like, the red means you spent the most, but I was like, okay, it's the light pink and, like, the gray. You spend almost nothing. Or I don't know if there's, like, a color code thing going on with that. I mean, the red is obvious. You spent the most. But I'm not sure about the other colors other than that. I like the little graph thing that I saw on your screen and pretty happy with the rest. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:51
Okay, now if you had to compare, like, the app on the App Store with, like, what you saw in the prototype, like, which one do you prefer more than the other? 
M
MxL
56:09
No preference, probably. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:11
Okay, well, how about this? Which elements of each do you like? Like, if you had to, like, pick and choose, like, the menu of things from each one and to put into an app for yourself, like, what stood. Like, what stood out to you? Like, because I think, yeah, whatever you remember is probably the most significant in your head. 
M
MxL
56:37
I would keep the app as it. 
M
MxL
56:38
Is, and I would add in. 
M
MxL
56:45
One second. 
M
MxL
56:50
I don't know if, like, if I would want the watch list stuff on the app, because I'm wondering if that would make it, like, more cluttered for me to use. Or maybe, like, the app could have, like, a separate section, kind of like the thing I was talking about premium having its own section, so it's not bugging everything else. So, like, if the app had kind of, like, a separate section for, like, the watch List. I would like that. As far as the insight part, I wouldn't mind the things that you showed on your screen to be on the app itself on the very first page as soon as you open the app. But. Oh, and in the aura section, I would like for like these daily average spendy days and the watch out stuff to be on there. 
M
MxL
57:44
But yeah, I mean, I like them both equally. But obviously for my convenience, I would use the app more since I have my phone more often than on my laptop. 
M
MxL
57:54
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:56
Okay, got it. So basically like you would kind of keep the app as is with that like top to bottom kind of scrolling, but then certain elements you would like to be added in there. 
M
MxL
58:10
Okay, cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:13
That's actually like all the questions that I have. I just want to say thank you so much for your time. 
M
MxL
58:20
Thank you. 
M
MxL
58:22
I was wondering, I think when I first got like, I guess selected to be part of this, do I continue keeping the app and like sending updates to whoever was like messaging me back and forth about the app or like, how does that work? I. Because I think it said like, you keep the app for seven days, you're on it for like two to five minutes or whatever, have a call with Sherry and then I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do after. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:49
Oh, yeah, no worries. So you got the app like. 
M
MxL
58:53
Seven on the 23rd? 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:55
Yeah, yeah. Actually, I think for now this is probably okay because we have like a few more updates that we're going to. 
M
MxL
59:08
Push to the app. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:09
If we do have like a follow up conversation, there'll be like a different scope of work. 
M
MxL
59:15
Yeah, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:16
Yeah. 
M
MxL
59:18
We'Re probably done with that. 
M
MxL
59:21
And when does like the payment stuff work for the app? I wasn't there on that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:27
So that just coordinate with Yash from. He's handling that from the platform, so we'll just go through with that. If you do have questions, like, just email me if that's okay. 
M
MxL
59:41
All right, cool. Yeah, thank you so much. 
M
MxL
59:45
It was nice meeting you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:46
Nice to meet you too. 
M
MxL
59:47
