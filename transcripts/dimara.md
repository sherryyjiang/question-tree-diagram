Hi. Yes, I had to fix my microphone settings. 
Yeah, no problem at all. How are you doing? 
I'm doing fine. It's a good day. 
Yeah, yeah, it's good. 
Where do you currently. 
Sorry? 
Oh, you're fine. I was asking. How about you? 
Yeah, yeah, I'm good as well. Yeah. 
Where. 
Where do you live right now? 
Columbus, Ohio. Could you hear. Hello? 
Hello? Sorry, I think there's. 
Did you. 
Something wrong with the connection? 
Oh, okay. 
Hello? I can't hear you. Yeah. 
Could you hear me now? Still can't hear me. 
I don't know what happened. Yeah, earlier I was able to hear you. 
Could you hear me now? Hello? Could you hear me now? Hello? Still nothing. Can you hear me now? Hello? Could I use your phone? 
Let me see if it's my fault. 
Hello? Hello? 
Oh, yeah, hi. 
Okay. You hear me? 
Yeah, I wonder if it's my. Like, I just took off my headphones and I can hear you now. So now I'm like, oh, no, what if it was my fault the entire time? But I think we should be good now. 
Okay. 
Sorry. Let me just make sure I have everything in front of me. All right, sorry, Give me one second. 
Give me one. 
System was also being very slow, so I had to restart a few things. 
Okay. Yeah. 
All right. Okay. I think. I think we're probably good. Great. All right, cool. Thanks for the delay. Thanks for your patience with the delay. So I'll introduce myself and we can get into it. So I'm Sherry and I'm doing research for a company called Peak. And we're looking to understand how young adults are making decisions around money a bit better to help guide some of our product decisions. So the purpose of this interview is in. Is in two parts. First part is to get to know you a bit better and how you've kind of made some decisions around money. And then the second part, we'll be running through a few different, I guess, tests using apps as well as using. Using GPT. I'll guide you through that part. There'll be some instructions, so don't worry. 
Okay. 
Any questions before we get started? 
I don't know. We can go ahead and get started. 
Okay, cool. So tell me a little bit more about yourself. So you live in Ohio. Have you been living there your whole life? What do you currently. All those kind of details. 
Okay, so I'm originally from Pennsylvania. It's a small town in Pennsylvania called Meville. And I moved out to Dayton, Ohio, with my mother. She followed her mother. And then as I got older, I. My dad Lived in Columbus, Ohio. So I moved out here with him around 16, 17 and then been here since. I'm currently 24. I'm gonna be 25 in March. I have four beautiful little girls and my boyfriend and I soon to be fiance, we're gonna be. Thank you. We're gonna be moving soon and I like to do like creative things like I like to create like soaps, body butters, work with skin and stuff like that. Yeah, that's a little bit about me. 
Got it. When is your birthday? In March, because I also have a March birthday. 
March 17th, St. Patty Day. 
Oh, very cool. On March 5th. 
Okay. 
Yeah, very cool. How old are your girls? You have four of them. 
Yes. So my oldest is six. I had her when I first came out here and my second is three and then I have two one year olds on. My youngest just turned one actually this month. So. Yeah. And my one year old is going to be two so they just caught up. They got that little gap where they're the same age. 
Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's so cute. Must be, must be a lot of fun. 
Yeah. Oh my goodness. Never a dual moment. 
And tell me more about your I guess hobby around making like soaps, body butter, different kind of crafts. So do you like to do like DIY kind of I guess goods there. 
So I like to do like all natural, just like natural products and stuff like that. So I started off like I just always was like a science project type of girl so I just knew that I would. And I love to bake, so I like to bake cupcakes and stuff like that. So it's all around the same thing. Just, it's just all about making people happy. I just love seeing people's reaction when they get my product. They're just, it just makes me happy too. Like it's just something I really love doing. Yeah. Yeah. 
Amazing. And how do you, I guess you've been. Been out in Ohio for a while. What, What? How do you like living in Ohio versus Pennsylvania or is just too long ago that it's hard to compare. 
So I visited Pennsylvania a lot growing up and it's more of a quiet, slow type of vibe and the people's like, you know, just very slow and chill. Even the driving is calm and then Columbus is very fast paced and there's so many people. So I would say I would like the calmness of Pennsylvania, but I would love Columbus for more like experience and just getting out there, being able to network more. 
Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. And I guess currently, you know, what are the. What are the kind of things that you're doing to, I guess, manage money? Because, I mean, I'm sure you have stuff for yourself and then you have stuff for the kids. So like. 
Yeah, yeah. 
How does. 
Yeah, I try to do. I try to go based off a percentage. Sometimes it's not exactly that percentage. I try to do 70% for my needs, 10% to save, and then 10% for giving. Like either anybody or family, anybody I know that needs anything. So I, I have my money I put to the side, but I also use. I was using this bank I had would track my spending for me. 
Yeah. 
And it would help me and show me the categories. But when I got on your guys's app, it was a little more different. Like they actually explained and broke it down and gave me some solutions to actually help me with my spending. So that's what I liked a lot. But other than that. Yeah, I just did it all on paper. 
Yeah, yeah. So you were, you said that you were doing it like roughly off a percentage of like 7 70, like the needs and then 10 giving. And I guess the rest would just be for yourself or whatever you kind of wanted, like, as in like a more fun budget. Is that how. Yeah, yeah, got it. When it comes to like the needs category, like, what are some of the main things that go in there for you? 
I'll definitely say diapers. We're always gonna need diapers. And then our clothing, our essentials, like toothpaste, body wash, things like that. My bills. I have a lot of those. Some of my subscriptions. And then, yeah, like rent, like, stuff like that. That's major. That's like the major need. 
But yeah, gotcha. And then how about the 10% that you like to spend on yourself? Like, what do those usually, like, end up being? 
It'll be like me doing something like just doll myself up or just get like some outfits or something, or treat myself to like a meal out to eat. 
Yeah, got it. And then like, I guess giving is like family, etc. 
Yeah, yeah. Even if it's just like sending on cash app or something like that. 
Yeah, yeah, makes sense. You said that you actually downloaded the app and tried it out. 
Yeah. 
Okay, got it. We actually didn't need it for this particular session, but that's good to know that you gave it a spin. What we're trying to do also is trying to make it like a little bit more accessible and easy to figure out what to do because sometimes a bit More. Bit more high level. Like a lot of numbers and stuff. So if you think about, I guess the last few things that you spent money on recently that like, made you really happy or like brought you a lot of joy, what are those things that come to mind? 
Actually, me, I took my daughters to this like, interactive museum. Yeah, it's super awesome. They like have things like. They have little rats that could play basketball. 
Little rat What? 
Yes. They're like a science and they. They like, . I can't explain it, but it's something. It's like the senses that the mice have for the ball and they're able to play little basketball on a little basketball court. It's the most craziest thing ever. 
Insane. 
Yes. Cool. 
Little rats. 
I was literally just so skeptical when I saw the flyer. I'm like, huh? But they do like, things like that a lot. 
I'm like, I'm looking this basketball. 
Yes. It's called Cosi Science Center. 
That is. I. I actually did see it. 
Yeah. 
That is crazy. That is. Yeah, that's crazy. 
It's so amazing. 
Oh, that's so funny. Okay, so you took your daughters to rap. See Rap basketball. 
Yeah. And they also have like a little play area and a little where they can go and sit and see like a planetarium. It's like a big screen that shows like, the space and all that. They have different sections in there. So that was a really. That was one of my happiest spins I did recently because we've been in house a lot with the new schedule, new baby, and that was like our time out. It was so nice. 
Oh, it was the youngest's first time out. 
Yes. Okay. Out going somewhere like that. She. She usually goes to the grocery store and stuff like that, but she's never been somewhere like, with a lot of kids and excitement. 
Yeah. Yeah. No, that must have been super fun. And how about like, I guess thinking back now, you know what you spent money on recently that maybe you didn't feel the best about or felt like, oh, you know, wasn't worth it. What are some of those that come to mind? 
Okay. Recently, I'll say food delivery. Yeah. Oh my goodness. Food delivery. Food delivery. And some subscriptions that I forget to cancel. That's really annoying. But yeah, I really just say food delivery. Like, I really have some days where I just will not feel like cooking and it just. And I'll really. I'll look back at my money and I'll just see that's what took a lot. Like a big chunk or going to the store for, like, little things. Yeah. 
So when you said going to the store for little things, like, what would those be? 
Like, I'll say, like snacks or just things that I really wouldn't need or the kids wouldn't need, but I'll just grab it because I'm craving it or I'm out at the store and I see it. 
Yeah. And. Oh, sorry. 
Continue. 
Sorry. 
Oh, no, you're fine. I was saying that. I was just wrapping it up. I said it adds up a lot. Little things. 
No, no, it does. And I guess when you're, like, out in the store and, like, you just get like, you know, stuff here and there. Like, have you. Do you notice if there's like a particular, like, I guess, like, trigger for it? Is it like, oh, like, I'm just really craving something? 
Yeah. But I don't know if it's the colors. It's just once you see it and you just think of the taste, it's like, oh, it just triggers something in my brain. Yeah. 
Got it. It's like, you get it and then it's like, well, like, that doesn't last very long or. Yeah. 
I'm like, dang, was this worth it? 
Yeah. Then you're like, oh, I did this like a couple of times now. But yeah, for. For like, food delivery. Right. Like, do you like, is it like doordash or like Uber Eats that you work? 
Yeah, Doordash, currently. 
Yeah. Got it. And is it like, is there like a certain, I guess, time of the week that you notice? You're like, extra tired or don't want to plan and you just. 
Yeah, I believe it's the beginning of the week. Like. Yeah, yeah. Always around the beginning of the week after. I'm just doing everything over the weekend. Yeah, that's definitely. And I never even stopped it to think about that. 
Yeah. I mean, I'm sure it's like exhausting after the weekend and you're just like, oh, man. I just like. And the week gets started and you're be like, oh, just sometimes don't feel. 
Like it, I swear. 
Yeah, but I know food delivery. Yeah. It's not cheap. 
Yeah. Yeah. 
And then when you talk about, like, subscriptions that you forget to cancel. Are these like, streaming services, like Netflix or are you. 
So one of them is. And I don't really use it that much because one. One of the streaming service I have has everything in it. Like, I have Amazon prime and I have majority of, like, the cartoon stuff I need for the kids. So I really don't look at Netflix like that, but it will definitely charge no matter if you forget. And yeah, another one is like, Walmart Plus. Or it's like, I won't use it a lot unless I really need to get something from one more just easy access delivered to my home. So the charge for that is just unnecessary sometimes to. 
Gotcha. If you were to, like, kind of do it over, would you have the Walmart subscription? 
Probably not, because I do not use that as much. 
Mm. 
Unless I'm like, really looking for something specific that Walmart only has. Because Walmart does have some nice things. 
Yeah, they have a lot. They have a lot of stuff. 
Yeah, yeah. 
And sometimes, like after the holidays, like, they have, like a bunch of stuff on clearance. 
Oh, my goodness. And you just see the yellow and. 
You'Re just like, oh, I know. But then sometimes you end up getting stuff that you're like, oh, it was just so cheap. 
And then you're like, I'm not even using it. 
I know it can get you. Yeah. 
Yeah. 
And I guess, like, speaking of, like, shopping, what are some of the things that you like? I guess, like, you mentioned, like, outfits, because I think, you know, those are some of the things that are nice to, like, spend on yourself. What would you say is, like, how you shop in, like. 
Yeah. 
Like, what do you usually like to shop for? If you think back, like, the last couple of weeks. 
So the last couple. I've been getting hair care products recently. What? And because I've cut my hair to just restart and have it grow back, so I've been having to try different products. And my daughters. Oh, my goodness. I had to do their hairs and they have so much hair. 
Oh, my goodness. And then it's like, well, I guess the youngest maybe not too much hair. 
Yeah. One little ponytail in the front. 
She's like, yeah. 
Oh. So hair care, definitely. Outfits for them. Like, I love dressing them up. They love, like, certain characters, so they'll be so happy to have certain pajamas or outfits. And definitely socks. Oh, my goodness. I'll say socks. That's probably the most thing that I've got. Like, clothing wise, like, my little ones will definitely take their socks off and just. They'll be all over. We'll have one sock. Don't even know where one went. And my dog, so I have a dog. She's one and a half. So her food. Her food is a lot too. I had to get that a lot. She loves to eat. Oh, my goodness. This dog. 
Your dog? Dog's also a A girl? 
Yes, her name's Dakota. 
Oh my gosh. You have five girls. Then you've got your human babies and you have your dog. 
Dog babies. Baby y. And she's so clingy. 
Yeah, that's so cute. That's so cute. Where do you end up like finding you know, some of the items? Like do you like to online shop for them or do you like to go to the store directly to find. 
Them for certain things like their clothes? Yeah, I like to go to the store because the sizes be so off with my order a lot. But like Amazon, I love to use Amazon for like anything that like essential wise or socks, something like that. And then Walmart, they're good in store for like their girl clothes and stuff like that. They have a lot of good sales and you can get so many things for like 200 for each girl. I also love Target. Target is very good too. Yeah. 
Do you also get clothes at Target like the similar mark? 
Yeah, I get them for myself at one Target more than Walmart because they're so nice. 
Yeah, got it. And when you said you get stuff from Amazon for like essential items like these are the, I guess the toothpaste, the. Yeah, like those kind of things. 
Yes, yes. They have great bills on toilet paper and stuff like that. 
Yeah. But you wouldn't like, I guess get like more like fun stuff like clothes from Amazon? 
Yeah, probably not like some, I did it sometimes but some of the experience wasn't great either with the fabric being thin or just not fitting well. Yeah, so that's pretty much it. But their socks and stuff. Yeah, they're like their little training undies and stuff. 
Yeah, got it. And how about like for your, your dog, do you have, do you also get the same stuff from like or do you also get stuff from Walmart and Target or do you have like pet stores that you go to? 
Yeah, so I will use sometimes I'll do Petco or Chewy online and they have like a little gift card they give you once you make an account. So I end up trying it and then you could also subscribe and just pay $20 a month for them to send the dog food. So that's really great for that. But if I want to get like a collar or something like get her some cute things, I'll go in store. Yeah, most likely Walmart. Yeah, big retail to me. 
Got it, got it. 
I also stopped at Kroger for her actually. It was some nice things in Kroger. Okay. 
Gotcha. And I've actually heard. I've heard good things about Chewy. What made you decide to, I guess, subscribe and, like, buy stuff there versus, like, getting some of those, I guess, in the store. 
I realized that their pricing is a little more reasonable than I thought they have. Good. And that subscription thing, that. That's, like, really helpful. I'm very forgetful and I probably will run out of our food and be like, oh, we gotta get our food. Yeah. So that helps a lot. Then they also had the good promotion and just that. That deal that they gave me just to come and try them out, it really caught my eye. 
I'm like, okay, yeah, got it. You've mentioned a couple of times that, you know, you're. You're a girl that likes a good deal and who doesn't. And, you know, a lot of the times deals work out, which is great. Like something that you already wanted, and you're like, okay, great, I can get it, like 50% off or I can get, like, free. Have there been times where you saw a good deal, you caught something and you were like, oh, I definitely got it because of the deal, but when I actually think about it, I didn't really use the item as much. 
Yes. A couple of times. And I'll just get it and be like, okay, now I see why this is on sale. Yeah. 
What were some, like, examples that you can, like, remember from, I guess, the past? 
I know some things like kitchen appliances. Yeah, appliances. They would seem like a certain size in a picture. It would not be that size when it arrived. It is sometimes the quality of some products, like, it would be noisy or wouldn't run right. And it was just. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. 
Oh, it was. Was this stuff on am, like, Amazon then if you bought it, okay, so they had a deal. And then you're like, oh, this looks interesting. And then you're like, there's a reason why this was on sale. 
Yes. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Yeah. 
Anything like in the, I guess, space of, like, clothing or like, stuff for your pet that you got that you were like, got for the deal but then weren't satisfied afterwards, or generally speaking, you kind of know what you're getting, so it feels okay. 
I'll say. 
Yeah, probably her. 
I try to get her this pillow, like a pillow for her to lay on in her crate. But it wasn't big and fluffy or like the texture looked like in the picture. It was a little more ragged looking in person. It wouldn't fluff up as much as it looks so. It wouldn't. I just didn't like that. I was like, oh, no. 
Yeah. 
Also I got some appliances. Like, I mean, not appliances, furniture from my girl's room. Like a toy holder. Yeah. And it was like flimsy, but it looked all sturdy in the photo, man. 
It's. I guess it's like easy for stuff online because, I mean, in person you can like touch and feel and. 
Yeah. On. 
So you're like, okay, you have a better sense. But online I think it can be. 
Very. Oh, my goodness. You have to have a good eye, right? Yeah. 
I thought I heard someone say hi. 
Yeah. Oh, hello. Hi. 
Is that a dinosaur? 
Yes. He loves dinosaurs. 
Oh, my gosh. Hello. Hello. I don't have a dinosaur, but I have a. I don't know if you know what these are. These are capybaras. 
Oh, yeah. 
They're like pretty cute animals. 
Those are super cute. 
Yeah, I love. I'm like a three year old too. Yeah. I was just gonna say a little off topic, but I. I have a cat. I have two cats and sometimes I get these beds for them or toys and they don't use any of them. They just want to like, lie on the floor and then they want to play with like pencils. 
Yeah. 
Like, these are not designated toys. And I, I bought these things for you. But then. 
Yeah, that's Dakota. Like she would sniff her toy and then walk away and then go play. 
With something that's like completely not a toy. 
Yes. You want to stock. How about you have the chewy toy right here? 
Yeah, yeah. They think, they think everything is theirs. You know, there's no, like, oh, mom bought this for me as a toy. So this is the toy. They just are like every house, like, that's. That's fair game. Yeah. Cool. Well, thank you. Thank you so much for sharing so much. This first part, second part, I'm going to check with you for two things to run this part of the study. One is, do you have ChatGPT or some like, I guess AI chat that you can use? 
Yeah, yeah, I have ChatGPT. 
Okay, perfect. And then second is, do you have a bank statement or. It doesn't have to be a bank statement, just like any statement where you speak, spend money, like credit card statement, etc that you would be able to use. 
Yeah. 
Okay, perfect. So how this is going to work? Okay, so I'll wrap basketball on the table, this over. Just get a good laugh out of it. I'm going to send you a prompt. So basically a couple instructions to send to ChatGPT, which will do like a quick analysis on your spend and just like organize it a little better and then we'll just like run through. So basically you take those instructions and then you can add your like spending or bank statement to it as well. Run the analysis and then like we'll just go over a couple of questions together mostly just to like kind of get your reaction and your kind of I guess read on some of these spending areas. So yeah, let me just send you this. 
Okay. 
Instruction. It's going to be in the chat and take your time on getting things set up as well. Just let me know when you are ready. 
Okay. Okay. So I just had to paste that and send that statement over. 
Yes, just paste it into the. Yeah, so the statement plus the instructions in the GPT should be able to generate it. And then when you're ready just. Yeah, let me know if you can share your screen so I can be on the same page. 
Okay, I'm at the share right now. 
All right, So what I'll have you do is just get to the I guess go to the top again. Oh, okay. 
Just. 
Yeah, I guess like as you're going through just like in this first time, I guess first time you read through it just like kind of say what's on your mind. Like oh, this, okay, this tracks. Or okay, this is. It's surprising. I didn't expect it. Or okay, like yeah, like anything that comes to mind as you're looking at it. 
Yeah, this definitely does track though. 
Yeah. 
We don't have a car so we do use Uber to take trips and I do like my little meals and then my hair. This was around my birthday so that definitely makes sense. 700. I'm looking at it. I was doing a little better with the subscription. 
Yeah. It seems like you have. Looks like you have just two. Although I think maybe the subscription. Other subscriptions are showing up in entertainment. 
Yeah, yeah. 
I guess when you look at these. Oh yeah. 
I think that's my Amazon Prime. Oh yeah, I got a mattress from Home Depot around this time. Oh yeah. And this market is right by my house, so convenient snacks. Yeah. And I'm just like sometimes I need some ingredients that I forgot on a like delivery order and I won't be able to go to no other store because that's the closest one so I can always walk across the street. 
Yeah. Are there like I guess differences in prices between like showbiz and then I guess what you get at like Target or Walmart? 
Yeah, they're a little cheaper. Not. Not than Walmart, but then Target, definitely. 
Oh, okay, got it. So Target's the more expensive one, then Showbiz and then it's Walmart. 
Yeah. Yep, got it. 118 is baby. So many places. Oh, yeah. Extra Microsoft Xbox. That was the other one in Paramount. 
Oh, is this a Xbox like subscription or. 
Yeah, so they have a subscription for games like that you can play and you can go live with other people. 
Oh, got it. 
Do. 
Do you like playing Xbox? 
Yeah, I like certain games, but my boyfriend really loves it. But it's certain games that I really love, like since a child and I just can't get enough. Oh, there's Cosi. That was like our little every Sunday thing too, a while back when we slowed down. 
Yeah. Oh, the Cosi science. 
Yeah, yeah. And we get a great price. Yeah. 
I mean, 10 bucks to go and see all that stuff is very good. 
Yes. Little ones. When she was smaller, she was free and then my 3 year old was too, so she was free as well. 
Yeah. When I guess when you were going through what were some of the areas that I guess shocked you or surprised you or made you feel like, oh, that's kind of a lot. Or that's kind of confusing. Like what. Which one? 
I'll say the transportation is a lot. I mean, I know I would take. Right. But I did not know it was that much. 
Yeah. 
Because I see that they have food delivery, but most. Some of the rides are mixed in with the food delivery because there's only two food orders that I saw on there. 
Yeah. So you expected that you would have. You didn't expect to have that much on Uber, right? 
Yeah. Okay. My eyes kind of opened up a little while when I saw that. I can't remember what I got off Amazon. I said, I can't remember what that was. I got off Amazon. It was a day before my birthday though, so it's probably something birthday. That's why. 
Okay. Was this from. Oh, this is from last year, right? 
Oh, yeah, it is. 
Oh, okay. 
I keep forgetting it's 2026. I'm like, wait, last year? 
Yeah, yeah. All good. 
All good. 
I mean, I mean, it's not a. I. I wouldn't be surprised that it's hard to remember an Amazon purchase from like 2025. 
Yeah. 
You might be able to find it on the email receipt, but yeah. 
Yeah. That's crazy. Before I saw the breakdown of shopping at 700 is what really? 
What would you, I guess normally expect or what would you have thought Shopping would be more around. 
I'll stay around. Well, around this time. It does make sense. I keep saying that. I'm say that if I probably need to get another month statement, but. Okay. Yeah. Because this was around my birthday, so I would spend more than what I usually would. Yeah. But I'll stay shopping like regularly. It's probably gonna be around like four, five, I would think. Yeah, I would think. And food delivery, I would think that would be a little less. And definitely the ride. 
Yeah. Gotcha. So I guess like the top few items, you were like. Okay, like that's a little bit more than expected. 
Yeah. 
Do you remember what. Oh, sorry. Go on. 
Oh, no, I wasn't saying anything. 
Okay. Do you remember what Fashion Nova was? I know it's been a while. 
Oh, yeah. So that's a clothing website and they also have like shoes and things like that, like accessories. But I was getting. I think I was getting my dinner outfit. Oh, okay. 
Got it. So was this for your birthday dinner then? 
Yeah, so I had a birthday dinner and I had like a little get together with my friends and stuff. Like with cake and stuff. Okay. This Home Depot, that was a. Just a mattress. Yeah. 
If you want to try, you can add in another month. Like a. Yeah, non birthday month. And then it's a bit different because I. I totally understand. I was like, just like. Yeah, you can unpresent if you need to do that. 
Yeah. 
I mean I think like even just to get an outfit or a few things, like it adds up. But it's. I think it's okay to. It's okay to spend on your birthday. 
Yeah. 
Happens once a year. 
I went back a little far. Okay, let me see. There was some months I was just idle. Not really spending much. 
Yeah. 
And I just tapped one. 
Sorry. Can you hear me? 
Yeah, I can hear you. Okay. 
I just put on my headphones again. There's some repair guys over at our house because our flooring. 
There's something. 
Yeah, sorry, I was just talking to my partner because I'm being fixed. I hope the noise won't be too loud, but there's. Yeah. Some flooring they're fixing. 
That should be fine. 
My cat wandered in. He's here. Hello. 
Is it a boy or girl? 
This is a boy. 
Hi. 
Say hi. 
So adorable. Okay, I'm about to share my screen back up. Around 500. The groceries. Yeah, that sounds better too. 
So this. Which month is this one? 
Oh, this one, I think. Is it January? February. Oh, January. Okay. Yeah. 
Yeah. Okay. Got it, got it. Okay. 
Yeah, this seems A little more better. This is when I didn't really have all my subscriptions to. Get a little bit of Amazon. Yeah. 
Oh, that's interesting. I. I mean, I just noticed three of the Showbi markets were the same. 
Yeah. The same amount. 
Yeah. I'm like. And then the other two are, like, very close. Very. 
Oh, yeah. That's so crazy. Hi, baby. Oh, yes. When were riding scooters. Walmart. Yeah. I like this very much more. Yeah. Yes, baby. 
All right, he's joining the fun. 
Yeah. Go tell dada I'm almost done. Okay, Thank you. He's downstairs. It's not. 
Anything like, as you're going through this, like, stand out to you for this month or you feel like this one's, like, pretty. 
I like this one a little better, but short. Shelby's is. Is sticking out. 
Okay. 
But this is around the time that I didn't really know the area that much, so this was, like, the closest. And I wouldn't go explore any further. So this makes sense. And that them 30. I just realized that's probably formula. That's why it's just so. 
Oh, yeah. That's why it's, like, basically the same. 
Yeah, definitely. 
Did you. Did you all just move to a new place around this month? 
Yeah, it was around the 22nd, I think. Yeah. 
Okay, got it. 
And I just realized my Walmart plus payment was cheaper than it is now. 
Yeah, they probably raised the prices. 
That's crazy. 
Okay, is there, I guess, is there any area where you would want to ask more questions to, like, find out what you spent somewhere? 
I would say groceries, but then I just know, like, especially when I take my girls in the store with me, this is going to be a lot of spending going on. So I would. I would just say the Uber eats one for $50. I usually wouldn't spend that much on. 
Uber Eats for, like, one for one meal. Right? 
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds crazy. 
And for, I guess for Amazon, those are usually just like you mentioned before, like, essentials, right? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. And I was. I was decorating the house around that time, probably. 
Okay, so you have, like, a few things you have to get. 
Yeah, Like, I remember getting a dish. Dish drying rack from there. I also got a little mop that, like, heats up, like a little theme. 
Yeah, got it. 
No, that. 
That makes sense. It's like, I guess each month there's slightly different, I guess seasons. Like March was birthday month. 
Yeah. 
And then this month was moving month. So probably has some places that you're like, I'm new to the area. Sorry, my cat's to take. Excuse me. 
I'm surprised Dakota hasn't ran up here. 
I know sometimes he's just curious, like, what is she up to? Why is she not paying attention to me? I'm sorry. 
Yeah, definitely. Okay. 
Okay. So yeah, basically like March was birthday month, so a bit more maybe. Yeah. Like a bit more like shopping for perhaps, like. 
Yeah. A little more leeway. 
A little bit more leeway. A little bit more like it's fine. It's a reward or celebration. And then I guess this month there's more on like getting settled in a new place. And then also like, okay, I don't know where to shop for groceries yet. So like, showbiz is kind of it for now. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
You find out Audi's a little bit. 
Yeah. Oh yeah, I see. 
Yeah. 
As well. That did not. That was not there in March, I think. 
No. 
Why'd you switch to I guess Target and Walmart? Maybe better prices if I had to guess, but yes. 
And the products I can find very much more healthier, Just cleaner feeling. 
Yeah, yeah, got it, got it. Cool. Well, I think that actually is it in terms of my questions. I just want to say thank you for your time and sharing this. We are looking to build an app that like tries to understand people and I guess their like surrounding life a bit more to then help, you know, people figure out, okay, how do I not necessarily just like save money for the sake of it, but how do I make sure I'm spending it on the things that are most important. 
Yeah. 
Right. It's like if, you know, sometimes it's like some things like we are intentional about spending and we completely should. 
Right. 
For people we care about family, like celebration and sometimes things where you're like, oh, I was a little lazy and if I did that a few times, I didn't realize it added up. Just like making sure those are. Yeah. Like easier to see. 
Yeah. That's the best thing about looking back at it too. Like, because some people you. What you would like you would think we would, but nobody's really going back and just looking at all their spinning and analyzing. Like, where did I spend this much? Probably just thinking more about like worker bills. So this, it really is an eye opener. Like it just helps you. Yeah. Better next time. 
Yeah. And. And yeah, our aim is to like, I guess help different people do it in a way that doesn't feel like it's a chore. Like it doesn't feel like a lot of work or intimidating, but it feels like. I mean, just like talking to a person and just being like, okay. Like, it's okay that this happened. Like, how do we. How do we make sure we help you, like, you know, spend on the things you care about? 
Right. 
Start from a fresh slate. 
Yeah, definitely. 
All right, well, Damara, thank you so much for your time. I will. I think. I think we arrange this from userinterview.com Right, if I'm not mistaken. 
Yeah. Yeah. 
Got it. So I'm going to. Let me just check really quickly because I think we need to settle this off the platform because they weren't letting me reschedule on the actual platform. It was just, like, weird thing. But I will send an email after this call just, like, verifying that we finished this, and then we can settle the pay out from there. But thank you so much. I really appreciate it. 
Of course. I appreciate you, too. And it was a good talk. Like, it was great. I'm glad. 
I'm glad you enjoyed. I did. I enjoyed it as well. And your. Your daughters are so cute. 
Thank you. 
All right. You have a great day. 
You, too. Enjoy the rest of your night. 
All right. 
Bye. 
Bye.
