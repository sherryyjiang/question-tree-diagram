Hello. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
00:09
Hello. Hi Liv. Hello. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:14
Nice to meet you. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
00:16
Nice to meet you as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:18
Awesome. Well, glad you can make it. I'll do a quick intro on who we are and what we'll be doing, but want to spend most of the time just getting to know you. So Jeff and I are both doing research for Peak and we're here to. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
00:34
Learn a little bit more about how. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:35
People are making different money decisions, managing money, etc. So the parts of the interview will be firstly a couple questions to get to know you in general and then we'll also be showing a few different prototypes or different apps for you to play around with, for you to just, you know, describe what's top of mind when you're using it. How does that sound? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
00:58
Any questions? That sounds good. 
J
Jeff Min
01:01
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:02
Okay, awesome. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:03
So just to kick things off, tell us a little bit more about yourself. Where are you living, what you've been doing since you graduated, all of that. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:13
Definitely. So I'm living in, close to Pasadena in California, so near LA. And I'm living with my parents again. Graduated college May 2025. So I've been doing a few different like part time jobs. I'm working as a communications assistant for a non profit doing a little bit of like legal assistant work and also like selling reselling clothes. So those are kind of the things that I've been making money on and babysitting. So I don't have like a full time job yet. So. Yeah, so things will be interesting when you look at all that. But I studied sociology and psychology at Cal, so those are kind of my main interests and hopefully going into public health in the future. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:04
Gotcha. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
02:05
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:05
What made you. I guess where do you want to. I guess like when you think about like your overall career, like what's your, what are some of the goals or the things that you're thinking about? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
02:23
For myself, I feel like I want to try as many things as possible. I know a lot of. Oh also, is this going to be anonymized? Oh yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
02:35
So the. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
02:35
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:36
Nothing will leave a team. Just so you know, we're not going. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
02:38
To publish anything publicly with your name or anything like that. Okay. Yeah. So for future, I did my honors thesis researching women's health and like patients with breast cancer and breast cancer survivors. So that's something that I'm passionate about. I'm also passionate about writing. So. I kind of have a background doing writing more on the creative side or like writing about music and stuff like that. Like, but it doesn't feel like super viable as a career right now. So I think that's kind of why I've also been looking into public health. I did a lot of psychology research too. So kind of interviewing people like you all are doing and stuff like that. I know how it is. So. I guess trying to lean more into like those like harder skills that I got in college. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
03:34
Cause I feel like a lot of the stuff that I've been doing, like writing and all of that isn't as stable. I know that like a lot of people right now my age and like my friends are looking for a lot of jobs and assuming they're not going to be able to find one full time job, just at least for the present, despite their career goals. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:57
Yeah, yeah, I guess. How, how has like, I guess adjusting after Cal has been like, you moved to Pasadena? Like what's that been like? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
04:12
It's been, I don't know, it's been a little bit weird because I lived in Berkeley through the summer just like finishing up research and up there and so I've only been back for about four months. Okay. But I'm lucky. I have a good relationship with my parents and all of that. Also been. My mom is going to have a big surgery so I've been helping out with that and keeping busy that way. But people definitely have odd schedules now. Like my friends who have moved home, most of them have moved home, but everyone's kind of doing something different. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:44
Yeah, yeah, got it. And I guess like when it comes to like how you are like thinking about your spending. Right. So like I guess what. What'S your, what do you think you. Spend more of your own, I guess more of your money on right now. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
05:12
Yeah, yeah. Because I don't have to pay for rent. I don't pay for my own groceries right now because I'm living with my parents and all of that. So for me, I'd say I either spend the most money doing things socially like with friends. Like if I were to get coffee with somebody or go out to eat or. Since I do resell clothing, I feel like I spend a lot of money. Not a lot of money, but a lot of the money that I do spend would be like thrifting or buying things that I'm intending to make a profit on, at least most of it. And then like, yeah, just like things like that. But I would say socializing and eating out is probably the biggest expense. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:58
For I guess eating out or so or I guess for things that you're doing socially with friends Would you say the big portion. Biggest portion of it is, like, eating out right now? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
06:10
Right now? I feel like it is. I feel in college it was more like going to events, going to concerts. Even in high school, like, I would go to concerts a lot. So I feel like that was kind of the majority of what I was spending on.  but now it feels like. Coffee or something like that is just more in line with people's schedules. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:33
Yeah, got it. So meaning, like, I guess the change mostly is just around, like, who has time during, I guess, the set time to me. So coffee is a bit more flexible. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
06:45
Mm. Yeah. But I also feel like people are. It's almost like as if in college people acted or like you thought you had more money than you did, and then once you've graduated, even though you might be actually making money now, you're like, oh, crap. So I feel like people are kind of focusing more on, like, socializing but not spending money to do it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:08
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
07:09
Yeah. At least with my friends. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:12
Do you have, like, a point in time where you made that realization where you're like, oh, now that I have my own money, I am maybe gonna think about how I like it. I guess that social energy, like, differently. Like, do you recall, like, a moment where you had that click? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
07:32
I guess maybe just like, this summer. I think we all thought were gonna find jobs really easily. Post grad. Yeah. Fantasy. That definitely didn't happen for everybody. So I think that realization and, like, feeling that it was hard to find a job made money feel scarcer. Even if we had, like, the same amount of savings or, like, what was coming in was kind of, like, stable. It was just that weren't making a bigger leap in what were making. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:07
Got it. And, like, currently, like, how do you. I guess, like, how do you figure out, like, how much to budget for, like, I guess what you're spending on things. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
08:19
Socially. I don't have a set budget. I don't have a set way of keeping track of things. I kind of just keep track of it in my head, I guess. So we'll see if that's accurate or not. But. I think it's more based on individual purchases. Like, if an individual purchase feels like it's too expensive, I wouldn't do that versus I would make a lot of little purchases. Yeah. So that's probably, like, a cognitive failure there, but kind of the assumption that a lot of little purchases will be cheaper than going to get a few larger purchases, like a coffee versus a meal or something. And. But if I am buying things, like, for fun, like Black Friday or something like that. I'm keeping track of that, like, writing it down. Okay. So calculating that. 
J
Jeff Min
09:19
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:20
So for certain things, like, you are, like, making, I guess, like, a specific budget for, like. And how did you determine, I guess, the budget for Black Friday. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
09:34
Or that my birthday was right before Black Friday. So I had received some money from my grandmother as a birthday present and for my parents. And so that was kind of my budget. Like, I didn't want what was in my bank account to change. But, like, the cash that I was given was, like, spendable. And then I tried to save part of it as well in the future. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:58
And did you end up, like, spending, like, most of it? All of it. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
10:04
Spent. Like, three quarters of it, I would say. But I'm planning on returning some stuff. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:13
Oh, yeah? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
10:14
Yeah. But I'm a very picky shopper. I feel like since I was in high school, I feel like I have to think about purchases because I'm so used to thrifting. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:23
Yeah, yeah. Did you return them because, like, they didn't fit or you were like, oh, I just don't like it as much as I thought I would. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
10:34
One thing didn't fit. They just came today. So one thing didn't fit. And then the other thing, it doesn't look as good as I would want it to for the price. And so I feel like I can find a cheaper version of it myself. Just a pair of leggings. Yeah. It's kind of like that buyer's remorse or it's like, the deal got me, but the product is not delivered. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:02
I guess since we're, like, talking about it, I'm, like, kind of curious in general around, like, how you typically do shopping, because I know Black Friday is like, you know, a once a year type of thing. You mentioned that you also do some thrifting as well, and you also resell. So I'd love to just step into, like, your, like, I guess, cycle around. Like, how much do you, like, spend time doing the. Doing thrifting for the sake of, I guess, keeping your outfit versus, like, buying with the intention of reselling. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
11:40
Yeah. Whenever I go, when I go thrifting with people, like with my friends or my mom or my boyfriend, like, that thrifting would be for fun and for keeping for myself, but when I go by myself, it's for reselling. So. Now, like, at this point, I would say, like, two thirds of my thrifting would be for reselling. And 1/3 would be for fun for myself. Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:16
And do you find yourself buying stuff that belongs more in the category of like, oh, this is fun and. Nice to have, or like, did you have something in mind before you went shopping and you wanted to get that specific item? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
12:30
Definitely. It's fun and nice to have. I. Yeah, I think I have a lot of random things that don't necessarily fit together. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:42
Got it. So would you say like right now, like, I guess zooming out a bit. Like you said, you spend time like, you know, grabbing meals, coffee with friends socially. You also like go shopping socially as well. Is there anything else that you do to I guess spend time with people that are outside of these two? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
13:07
Live music still. So usually cheap. Cheap, live music. I'm not someone who buys like a 300 concert ticket. I'll go to like backyard show or a smaller show. Hiking. I really enjoy hiking. Walking with people. That's like another thing that my friends and I like to do together. Yoga classes. Those are some of the main ones. And then just doing like arts and crafts projects, writing together. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:40
Yeah. So for yoga you do that more with like other people versus, like, I guess going by yourself? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
13:49
Lately I just go by myself. I was more in college. I would go a friend or something. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:53
Yeah, got it. So I guess when we. When looking at like, I guess everything related to like how you're spending and everything, are there like particular like, I guess areas that make you a little bit more anxious or more like I want to pay more attention to this to like potentially change that in the future. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
14:26
This is kind of a current one, but gym membership. Yeah. I like joined Anytime Fitness in the summer and I'm. They're so hard to get in touch with and I feel like they're going to auto renew my plan. So. So I mean, that's kind of like the gym membership dilemma. I'm sure that's common, but I guess keeping track of things like that, like cost per use of a purchase like that. So like, I know like if the membership was 100, it was $175. So I like want to keep track of how many times I go to see if it would be worth it for me to renew that. So that could be helpful. But things I would want to keep track of. Probably just if I'm buying something at the same place over and over again. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
15:23
Like if I go to a store, if I could see I'm going to Savers and spending like X amount of money every month or I am like buying new underwear. A lot or something like that. I need to keep track of that so I wouldn't make unnecessary repeat purchases. I think those are the things I'd want to keep track of. 
J
Jeff Min
15:45
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:47
Do you have an idea in your head of how often you are doing that or not really? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
15:54
I guess I do. I do have an idea of it. I'm not. I don't make a ton of transactions. I feel like. And then when I was living by myself, I think groceries too, or something that would concern me, especially when I was eating out. Like if I had just spent a lot of money on groceries, then I wouldn't want to eat out or I would be concerned about the cost of those two together. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:25
And then once you figure out like a full time job, what area to spend more money on, do you look forward to having? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
16:37
I think travel. For me. I don't feel like I need more possessions. I have a lot of stuff I'm trying to downsize. So I think experiences probably like things that feel more adult and like you have to have adult money to do them. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:57
Yeah, like travel or more concerts. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
17:01
Or more concerts? Yeah, definitely. But I would love to like have the freedom to travel more to see my friends who have moved across the country or something. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:12
Yeah, that must be hard. I mean, I'm sure some have stayed in the Bay Area and some have gone. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
17:18
Yeah. Everyone'S very far flung now. And my brother moved to Berkeley right when I graduated because he's going there now. So kind of a flip flop. Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:34
And then you also mentioned something earlier that I wanted to dig into a little bit more. You, you said that you do track like some of the stuff like in your head. I just want to get a sense of your, I guess, thought process. Like. Maybe just give a example from like the last week or maybe the last couple of days. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
18:00
Like with an individual purchase or like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:03
Yeah, you mentioned that you do more so from like an individual purchase point of view, you gave Black Friday. I think that was example, if you can think of maybe something like else there. And then what kind of thought process went through your head when you were about to make the purchase after you made the purchase? And yeah, okay. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
18:31
For I guess, like I just saw my friend on Monday. So the fact that Black Friday had just happened was like in my head. So I knew I didn't want to do something expensive with my friend. So we decided to get coffee and went into like the downtown area that I live by. And then I picked the cheaper coffee shop. Like I picked Starbucks instead of the like nicer coffee shop because I had gone there with another friend, like, two days before. So. I guess that was kind of the calculation in my head. And I only probably saved, like, $2. But I was kind of thinking about what had happened before. But if I had gone to the nicer coffee shop a week before, I probably would have gone there again. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:20
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
19:21
Even though. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:23
So it was more about just, like, how you felt in the more recent state of mind where you're like, okay, I just, like, bought a lot of stuff. 
J
Jeff Min
19:30
I will. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:32
I just want to exercise some discipline, even in a small way. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
19:36
Yeah. Like, even if the result isn't that big, it feels better psychologically. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:42
Gotcha. And how often do you find yourself doing that? And maybe if there's another example where you did the same thing where, like, you spent something and then you're like, okay, like, the next time I do something, I'm gonna just adjust my hat. My thinking a little bit. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
20:05
Yeah. There was. I was, like, recently in the Bay Area, so I was visiting my brother and my boyfriend and, like, some of my friends, and it was, like, the first time I was seeing one of my best friends in a really long time. So went to a cafe, and then went thrifting, and then we had dinner. So it was kind of like the day kept getting longer, but because weren't anywhere that either of us lived, we kind of had to just, like, keep spending money to stay out. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:37
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
20:39
So I think, like, when went to the cafe, I, like, didn't care how much I spent. And then once went thrifting, I was, like, thinking about it a little bit more. And then at dinner, I, like, consciously picked a cheaper option on the menu because of what I had spent earlier that day. When initially I hadn't really been thinking about what I was spending when the day started. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:02
Got it. Got it. And. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
21:05
And did you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:07
Did you have, like, a spending range in mind or you didn't. I guess you didn't or didn't think about it until, like, towards the end of the day? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
21:16
Yeah, I didn't think about it towards the end of the day. I think that's. Yeah, that's a good thing to point out. I don't think about how much it is collectively. It's kind of just, like, on the vibes individually. Yeah. So there's no, like, budget per day. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:32
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
21:33
But I know that if I were to move out and, like, have a lot more, like, living expenses, that I would do something like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:40
Yeah. Yeah, Makes sense. And do you have A opposite, I guess, instance where, like, you. Let's say you made money from reselling or you got paid from, like a gig and then it made you want to spend more money than usual. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
21:58
Yeah. I am just, like, submitting a bunch of timesheets for some of my jobs because it was like the end of November. So even though I spent a lot of money last week, there's something I wanted to buy on Depop. So I just, like, bought it last night. And it's more expense. It's a hoodie. It was more money than I would have usually paid for something like that. But it felt like a. Because it's a resold object. It felt like I wouldn't be able to find it again because it isn't produced anymore. And I think I just had the confidence to buy it because I know I'm going to be getting my paycheck soon. Yeah. So I think having like a more. Having a more stable work schedule as well also impacts that. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
22:43
Like, if I can think, oh, well, if I work for two hours, I'll pay that off or something like that. And I worked that amount of time that day, I'm like, okay, this is fine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:54
Gotcha. So you are doing a little bit of that math at least within like, a certain window of time where it's like, okay, I see how much this is, and then this is how much I know I'm going to work and get paid. That math evens out. You'll go for it. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
23:09
Yeah, exactly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:10
Got it. Usually how long of a time period is that? Like, would you remember if it was within, like a week or two weeks? Or is it more like, oh, yesterday I was doing this, and now I'm gonna. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
23:24
For that purchase. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:26
Yeah. Just for that purchase. Yeah. I know it's hard to remember. In general, we do a lot of stuff. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
23:31
It took me, like three days to buy it after I decided I wanted it. And I wasn't going to buy it. But then I think because I had just left work, I was feeling like, it's fine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:48
Got it, Got it. See if there's anything else I would ask. It was pretty detailed. Jeff, do you have any questions? 
J
Jeff Min
24:00
No, I'm okay. Thank you. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
24:02
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
24:02
By the way, I think we're born on the same day. By the way, Liv, were you born, like a day before Black Friday? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
24:08
Was I what? 
J
Jeff Min
24:11
Like a day before Black Friday? Did I get that right? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
24:15
Pain. 
J
Jeff Min
24:17
Sorry. Were you born on the day before Black Friday? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
24:20
Oh, I see. Sorry, sorry. No, I was born on November 16th. 
J
Jeff Min
24:25
Oh, 16. I thought you were born day before Black Friday, so I was like super excited because that's. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
24:30
So is it just your birthday? 
J
Jeff Min
24:32
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
24:33
Awesome. Happy birthday. 
J
Jeff Min
24:34
Yeah, well, same to you. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
24:36
Thank you. November babies are the best. 
J
Jeff Min
24:39
Yes, that's correct. All right. For the distraction. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:45
No, no, it's okay. 
J
Jeff Min
24:46
I feel like holding it off. Okay, let's move on to the next section. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
24:53
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:55
Actually, so now we'll just have you, like run through a few prototypes. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
25:03
Actually. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:03
Jeff, do you have the link to send over to live? 
J
Jeff Min
25:07

Sorry, the Valleys one? Yes, yes, sure. Just paste in the link. There you go. Should be correct. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
25:35
Should I. Sign up to do it? 
J
Jeff Min
25:39
Yeah, maybe. Maybe I'll just like walk through, I guess, the scope of the exercise. So you will have to sign up. You can use any Gmail. What you can do is you can use, I don't know, a sample bank statement. So in previous interviews, what people did was they used their most used credit card statement or bank statement and uploaded it. What the system will do, the app will do is the app will extract your transactions, categorize it, and you'll be then proceeded to the next screen, which will then include the actual, I guess, testing that. We'll like to do a demo. 
J
Jeff Min
26:26
Basically, during the demo, we would love you to have like a microphone to put a microphone to your head and like, just literally like blast out anything that comes across your mind just so that we're learning how you're using the app and you know, the feelings that you're having, the emotions that's going through. So there's no right or wrong answer. There's a right or wrong way to use it. If it sucks, just let us know that it sucks. There are no hard feelings. That's the whole purpose of this demo process. If there's anything particular that you like or you hate, just point it out. We're going to be very mute intentionally, just so that we're not interrupting or influencing your thoughts. So don't mind that we're just like two people just sitting there looking at you with awkward faces. 
J
Jeff Min
27:15
That is a whole bunch of sympathy. Yes. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
27:19
That'S good. 
J
Jeff Min
27:20
Yep. If there are any technical issues, you let me know. I'm here to help. Once you have signed up and uploaded, it will be great to have you share your screen so that we can also see through, like the buttons that you're clicking, what's going through, etc. So that we have more context. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
27:38
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
27:39
Okay, thank you. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
27:40
Let me just grab. And. And will the statement be saved or will it be. 
J
Jeff Min
27:50
No. So at the end of the process. You can basically clear it off. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
27:55
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
27:56
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
27:57
Awesome. Can you see it? Well. Did it mess it up? 
J
Jeff Min
30:02
Sorry, I was. I. Keep talking. I just realized. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
30:05
Did I make it, like, really bad? 
J
Jeff Min
30:06
No, no, no, no. Sorry. You can click on Continue. I think the file went through. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
30:12
Okay. It's showing like an infinity screen for me. Does it look like that for you or you guys. 
J
Jeff Min
30:18
Yes, we're staring down the infinity black hole. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
30:21
Okay, let me fix it. Sorry about that. 
J
Jeff Min
30:26
It's okay. I think you can just choose to share a tab or something. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
30:32
Oh, my goodness. 
J
Jeff Min
30:58
Oops. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
30:59
I'm sorry. 
J
Jeff Min
31:00
No, no, it's okay. Take your time. I think you're in Safari, so I won't be of much help. I've not used Safari in a long time. Try sharing just one tab. That could fix a problem. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
31:25
Okay. Maybe I can. Window. Is that working? 
J
Jeff Min
31:45
Yes. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
31:46
Okay. Awesome. 
J
Jeff Min
31:59
Okay, you've got two files selected. Yep. They'll look a little bit weird because you're using it on a computer whereby a lot of other interviewees were using on mobile. So it looked a little bit, I guess, stretch out, but that is fine. You should still be able to use the app and look through the text. So it's okay. I just wanted to give you a heads up. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
32:32
Thank you. 
J
Jeff Min
32:36
This is. Did you upload the bank account or a credit card statement, if I may ask? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
32:44
Statement. 
J
Jeff Min
32:45
Okay. Which bank are you using? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
32:51
I use School's financial Credit union. 
J
Jeff Min
32:54
Okay. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
32:56
So this is my debit card statement. 
J
Jeff Min
32:59
How long have you been using this account? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
33:02
I've been using it for three years. 
J
Jeff Min
33:05
Wow. Okay. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
33:07
Yeah, I actually don't have a credit card. That's something. 
J
Jeff Min
33:11
Yeah. I was going to ask if you consider other options. Oh, right there. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
33:18
Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
33:20
Actually, you might be missing some text. Can you scroll up a little bit so that you can. There you go. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
33:24
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
33:25
This is where the app begins. So I'm just going to put on. Put myself on mute and like I mentioned, just go through the app and just let us know whatever that comes through your mind. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
33:37
Okay, sounds good. I guess I'm immediately thinking the values are going to be financial because the app is financial. So when it's asking what matters to me, I'm not thinking only what matters to me as a person, but what matters to me financially. It's hard to pick. Interesting. I think growth insecurity. Like I usually would have grouped those together, but I do see that they're different. These are the ones I'm going to pick for now because I'm not living at Home. I'm not going to pick those or I am living at home rather. This makes it easy to know that you're supposed to drag and drop using that. But I could see an older user thinking they had to press the middle of the screen or something. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to click on these or what will happen. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
35:46
I think sometimes if I'm using an app, if I click on something or a website. I'm afraid that if I select that option because I'm looking for more information from it that it will like irreversibly select it. I always say that's about expression. And was also. Yeah okay, I like that I can pick two options because it was also a one off purchase because I got a new phone so I needed a new phone case it. I think the prompts changing here they like changing a little too quickly. Or it might be nice if it had one prompt and then a line to write and then a prompt and then a line to write just to keep track of what questions it's asking. And I feel like I don't need to respond to that one. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
37:25
So that's why I'm going to stop typing for this one. I think this is good. That's also what made me think when it sorted it into expression. What would you like to explore? I'm interested in this. I'm thinking maybe I didn't review more purchases so it's not taking those into account. R. I'm going to see more of the purchases, see if they can get tagged. Okay, here we go. I'm glad I could navigate back to the screen and it didn't get lost. Oh okay. Since I only uploaded one statement, it's thinking this is the first time I've been here. But that wasn't true. I'm not sure how to tag it since it's. This is money that I spent for reselling. So I don't know how I would tag it using these options. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
39:50
So maybe for people who have business expenses and stuff like that could be another option. I guess I'll put it as growth because it's like a business that I'm trying to do. So. Oh, and this is cool that it's using these insights and keeping track of them. I kind of thought it might just be a journal prompt where the user keeps a log of it or whatever. Now I'm having to think about what I bought. This was with my mom so were thrifting for fun. And. Okay, this was going out to eat with my boyfriend I got. I think I just got one taco. I like the timeline. I think this is really interesting. I haven't seen, like, any banks or anything, which is the only, like, budgeting type. Website I've been to. Use the timeline, and I think it's really helpful. 
J
Jeff Min
41:32
You might want to choose another date. I think there was. Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
41:36
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
41:37
Yep. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
41:37
Oh, here we go. Okay. This was at the airport. So that was just buying water at the airport. I'm gonna write. Okay. This was also with my friends. It's all food. But these are all. These are all with people. So I guess I'm going to tag them as connection. But it's not necessarily only that. This was for fun. So it's expression. And then this was also with friends. This was like. Joy. I'm forgetting the difference between joy and expression a little bit as I go through this. But I bought two CDs. It kind of feels more like necessities because even though I was with. My boyfriend, I feel like were just going there because we really needed to eat. So it's kind of hard to pick for that one. This was also just clothing purchase. This was for my new phone. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
43:34
This was like part of the payment. Kind of like growth, I guess, and also a necessity. I could edit this one, though. I wanted to add more information to this, but I feel like I can't. 
J
Jeff Min
43:56
What kind of information would you like to add? You can't edit it right now. We haven't built that feature. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
44:02
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
44:03
If you were given an option, what would you have liked to add more? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
44:08
I just forgot to write at the bottom what the purchase was. So maybe the ability to, like, go back and add to it. Or maybe in the future the ability to link the specific purchase that you made so that you could see what the item was. 
J
Jeff Min
44:30
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
44:31
There's an app called Shop that I use sometimes. And you can track your purchases on there, but. Or like, track your packages. But I feel like the. It's only fun or, like, useful to use when you can see the picture of the item versus the ones you manually input. You can't see the picture. 
J
Jeff Min
44:51
Oh, I see what you mean. How often do you shop at. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
44:56
I used it like two or three years ago, and then I kind of forgot about it until Black Friday because one of my items automatically routed onto there. And then I. I uploaded my other stuff, but the pictures didn't come up. And I feel like it wasn't. Wasn't very fast, so I didn't really like it. This was like Halloween. So I'm gonna Say that. See what it. 
J
Jeff Min
45:33
And then. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
45:36
This was also for fun. Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
45:40
You have a pretty good memory. You basically rate it for like across a whole month. I think. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
45:51
I don't. I mean, maybe I spend a lot. I guess we'll see. But I feel like I'm not making a ton of transactions all the time. And usually when I'm spending it's with other people. So it's more memorable. Yeah. I think it's because I'm not doing it by myself that I'm remembering what was happening. Okay, this is interesting. Oh, even just seeing this, I feel like I wasn't keeping track of that because my statement has also what's going into my account at the same time. And I also for my. My bank statements, like I keep everything in my savings account. And so it can be kind of confusing to understand my statement or read it very simply because everything is like a withdrawal from the savings into the checking, but it doesn't say what I was spending it on. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
46:50
Unless I look at the checking account statement next side by side. I almost wish there were subcategories of connection. I feel like at the beginning of like onboarding onto the app, that would be overwhelming. But for me, since I'm spending a lot of money on the connection category, I would like to be able to see what I'm doing because going through the timeline and addressing all my purchases and realizing I spent a lot of money on food as connection, that was basically all I did. But it would be interesting to think about how other things could be a form of connection and kind of call my attention to that. Like, even though it says I spent 21% on connection, it's kind of just like 20% on food, which I wouldn't say necessarily aligns with my values, even though that's what I value the highest. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
47:44
So now I'm going to pick one of these. Will you ask me anything? It's really fast and producing the responses, I think that's really standing out to me. I don't know what it means by Iraq. Maybe because I went to Nordstrom Rack. Not sure. I also appreciate that the background is purple. I have. This is kind of random, but I have a hard time reading white text on black, so I think the purple is helping a bit. Yeah. That it's not just black and white. I wish this text was a little bit bigger to be more readable. It might just because I'm on a computer, but it's really readable in bold, even in the same font size. It. I guess I'm confused about the difference between these two. Like what average monthly slice means since it only has one month from me. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
51:20
How it's getting this instead of $87. Yeah. I like that. It's not pushing products at me. I don't know. That wasn't really my expectation. But it's not saying like, oh, go, you could buy like this $30 petal or whatever. That's nice. I'd like the idea of the experience. I think this is really good. This is kind of what I was hoping to see. Something where you can set aside things I know I've seen online. People like stuffing envelopes for budgeting with cash. So something kind of like that where there's budgets for a lot of little things. But on the app would be great so that I could have those different funds. And it looks like that's a possibility. Wonder if there's anything else for me to explore. 
J
Jeff Min
52:34
Yep, that's pretty much it. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
52:37
Okay. Cool. I can keep looking around or we can talk again. 
J
Jeff Min
52:44
Sure, sure. I think you might get stuck because that might have disabled all the values that you have selected. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
52:50
Oh, no, it is okay. 
J
Jeff Min
52:54
If you want to play around again, you can just select it again. Or yeah, if you feel like you're deleting the data, you can also click on the reset button. That will delete all the data. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
53:03
Okay. Yeah. I guess. Is it good to reset now? 
J
Jeff Min
53:10
We can. Reset will just. Yeah. Up to you. Up to you. Or if you need a visual reference, you can just select my values and then we can talk through the flow and how you felt in specific areas. For now, I think you can just select random top three or five and then we can get into the tagging screen. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
53:34
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
53:35
Yeah, Yep. You can click on start tagging. And yeah, it doesn't matter if this is. Okay. Could you scroll to the one where there's still some untagged transactions? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
53:48
Yes. Okay, now it's working. 
J
Jeff Min
53:53
And now it's working. Okay. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
53:55
Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
53:56
Oops, the screen share disappeared. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
54:00
Oh. 
J
Jeff Min
54:10
Okay. Perhaps while you're doing that, I can start asking some follow up questions. The first thing, what was the first thing that came to your mind as you are like going through this exercise? How did it make you feel, this exercise? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
54:29
I felt a little nervous doing it in front of people. I didn't know what was going to be on there. Just like in terms of how much money I spent. But I felt kind of pleasantly surprised that I didn't spend as much as I thought I did. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:47
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
54:48
And then I guess I was also. Interested that it was all about spending and not about any of the money that was, like, coming into my account. I thought that was interesting. 
J
Jeff Min
55:02
How did the app experience make you feel? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
55:10
It didn't feel scary. I thought it might feel scary, but it did feel friendly. I feel like it moved well. And I liked the. I liked the insights it was able to produce very quickly. I think I wouldn't know how to produce those, like, just by myself, using a spreadsheet or something like that type of budgeting. And I'm curious if it gets to know you more over time and develops more specific insights for you. Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
55:48
What was that particular insight that you felt like it produced really fast and you wouldn't be able to, like, produce. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
55:57
Just knowing. I spent $87 on clothing and. 
J
Jeff Min
56:03
That. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
56:06
Like, regardless of what the. Because I think I tagged some as. I tagged some clothing purchases as connection and some as expression, so that across the categories, it knew what the item was. I thought that was good. And the, like, the different ideas for how to allocate more money towards adventure, I thought those were good. And I liked that it provided a range of options because I knew I didn't want to do a couple of them, but a couple of them also seemed like good options. 
J
Jeff Min
56:51
You were. I noticed during that testing you were also giving quite a number of comments to the little box. How does that make you feel? That's the first question. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
57:07
The, like the yellow box. 
J
Jeff Min
57:08
The yellow box, yeah. You're feeling quite a few of those. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
57:12
Yeah. I feel like it was good because it got me thinking about each purchase and it set me in that mindset to think more about each one. Even if I didn't interact with the bot while I was thinking about it. I wish that it hadn't kept asking more questions. I feel like I didn't think as deeply about each question because whenever I type something, it would generate another response or question. Yeah. But I think the basic things it was asking were good. Like, what did you get? And I liked that it was asking about how I felt. At the same time, I think that is a new thing compared to other, like a banking app or something. 
J
Jeff Min
58:01
Right, right. Just so that I captured that correctly, you. You like that it asks you questions, but you didn't like that it kept on asking questions? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
58:13
Yeah, I didn't like the rate at which it was asking questions. Like, if I had. If there was a question and then a response box and then another question had a new response box, like, that might better. 
J
Jeff Min
58:30
Right. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
58:30
You don't get overwhelmed. Yeah. Like a little survey But I do understand that the, like, the refreshing of it does make it feel like a conversation more. So I think there's advantages to both, because if it had presented as a survey, I might have just been like, okay, that looks like too much. I'm not going to fill out all of those. So there's pros and cons. 
J
Jeff Min
58:52
Which would you prefer? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
58:58
I think if there could be a combination where it looks like it does right now the first time, then you write one response, and then it pops to another one after you filled out the first one. I think that could be good. Or just keep it the way it is, but don't present every question at once. Does that make sense? 
J
Jeff Min
59:19
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
59:19
Okay. Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
59:24
If the. The little prom was coming in slower, would that change the experience for you? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
59:32
I think that would have helped. Or if it felt. It felt like sometimes it would ask a question that didn't feel very necessary, like, oh, tasty, like. Or, like, oh, what color phone case did you get? Like, that part doesn't feel as necessary to me. But then when it would say, oh, how did that make you feel? I wanted to write more. 
J
Jeff Min
59:55
Okay. That's actually very articulate. What. Okay, gotcha. Would you have. Okay, let me rephrase that question. How do you. Instead of, like, the AI just, like, I don't know, prompting you to. With these questions, how do you feel about having a button to trigger it? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:00:16
I think that could be good, but. Actually, I think that would just make it feel like you're using ChatGPT or something. I think that would make it feel more like AI, Like I'm asking for help. And I feel like the person using this might not want to feel like they're asking for help. They're just automatically receiving feedback. 
J
Jeff Min
01:00:36
Okay. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:00:37
Yeah. So maybe no button for me. 
J
Jeff Min
01:00:39
No button for you. Okay, thank you. Sherry, you wanted to ask a question. I know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:00:45
Yeah, I actually have to drop, but you guys can go. 
J
Jeff Min
01:00:49
Oh, yeah. Okay. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:00:51
All right. 
J
Jeff Min
01:00:51
I just realized. Running out. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:00:53
Nice to meet you. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:00:55
Thank you. 
J
Jeff Min
01:00:55
You still have about five more minutes, Olive. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:00:58
Yeah, definitely. 
J
Jeff Min
01:01:00
Okay. Actually, on your screen, there's one thing that I wanted to ask you. Can you unlock and launch it a little bit? I'm seeing a very narrow. Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I know you have an exceptional memory, but you just click on this. I. Okay, first of all, what do you think about this, like, message from Peak. This. This section. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:01:23
Okay. Again, it's kind of the situation where, I don't know, like, if I click one of, like, this feels like. 
J
Jeff Min
01:01:33
By the way, if you want. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:01:35
Okay. I guess this. I can't remember this response. Feels like I'm saying I can't remember this. But then if I clicked how was it? Or tell me more, that feels like a question Peak is asking me, not something that, like I wouldn't ask Peak, how was my taco? 
J
Jeff Min
01:01:51
Right. That's. I guess it's like the buttons are phrased from two different angles at one time. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:01:59
Exactly. Yeah. Like this feels like I'm saying this and these feel like Peak is saying it. 
J
Jeff Min
01:02:04
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:02:04
Okay. Or maybe. Yeah, maybe I could say tell me more. Like I'll see what happens if I say that. Okay, so then if it's tell me more, I'm saying that. 
J
Jeff Min
01:02:21
I can totally see by the way why, like, this conflict happens. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:02:25
Yeah. I feel like I don't. I didn't expect this response from the tell me more either. 
J
Jeff Min
01:02:34
Right. What were you. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:02:35
Because now it's telling me a story that isn't true about what I did. But. It does. Like, it's interesting that it knows how much I had spent there before. So I think if it presented this as more factual, like previously you spent 663, now you spent 1326. And even this part would be okay if it said it as well. And then like, I like that it remembers that this happened. So if it was more about factual things that had happened to me and not trying to create a story out of it, that would be great. 
J
Jeff Min
01:03:21
Okay. Okay, I see what you mean. Can you try clicking. Actually, let's just click on save tags and move on to the next transaction. And I have a follow up. I hope this is the one that is. Oh, this is also a first time. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:03:40
This is gross. 
J
Jeff Min
01:03:42
Oh yeah. Actually, what do you think of this statement? That or the message that Peak is telling you right here. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:03:48
Okay. So like, I know this wasn't a small treat. I know that this is a grocery store in my town, but it's not like a well known store, so I wouldn't expect Peak to know what it is. It might be helpful to be able to tag certain retailers. Like if I could tag this as a grocery store so it would know. 
J
Jeff Min
01:04:18
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:04:19
For the future. 
J
Jeff Min
01:04:21
Okay. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:04:21
Because it seems like there's kind of. There's like Peak is more into using like the feeling or like the purpose of the purchase for instead of what the purpose the purchase actually is, which I guess is what sets it apart. Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
01:04:36
Right. And how do you feel about that? Like between, I don't know, the feelings versus the mechanical nature of the span. Right. Like, what is it? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:04:46
Yeah. I think for things like necessities and one off and then maybe like the like my most used tag, I would like the opportunity to specifically itemize what the purchase was. But for something like joy or adventure, it's almost like I wouldn't care because I know that those are fun things where it's not as much about what it is versus groceries. It's like, okay, I'd like to know if I'm spending a million dollars on groceries every week. 
J
Jeff Min
01:05:22
Yeah, okay. Okay. So you like to bucket things like between sort of necessity and somewhat of a discretionary. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:05:33
Yeah, yeah, definitely. 
J
Jeff Min
01:05:37
Okay, cool. I'm going to ask you to like force you to actually click on that. I can't remember this button. Pretend that you don't have a great memory like you do and. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:05:50
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
01:05:51
See what happens. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:05:54
okay. See, it knows. That's good. I like that it knows what it was. That impresses me. Yeah, that was cool. Oh, and you can upload a receipt. This is interesting. 
J
Jeff Min
01:06:08
Would you do it? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:06:13
Honestly, I might. I feel like I really like being able to track things and I feel like I have extra time right now. So. Yeah, something like that I might actually do. 
J
Jeff Min
01:06:25
Okay. Okay. I appreciate that feedback. Would you also connect to, like you earlier mentioned about Shopify. Sorry, the Shop app, which I presume would also send you an email to your inbox. At least at some point. Would you also be willing to connect your Gmail and let Peak, like automatically extract those receipts for you? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:06:47
Oh, I see. I might not. I didn't actually connect my email to Shop. I decided to manually input the information. But that's just me. I don't know, kind of get scared. Also Google Calendar, I don't think I would connect that because to me that's more of a professional thing. 
J
Jeff Min
01:07:08
Right. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:07:09
And it makes me anxious. 
J
Jeff Min
01:07:12
Makes you anxious. Okay. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:07:14
Yeah. To like share that. Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
01:07:19
Was there any past experience that led you to have this behavior. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:07:28
With Google. 
J
Jeff Min
01:07:29
Calendar, I guess and like connecting these things? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:07:33
Oh. I think it's just hard to tell what permissions you're giving an app. And yeah, I actually like, I looked at Peak in the App Store before this call and I saw some of the reviews. People were saying they didn't like that they automatically had to connect their bank account. It made them anxious. I think I would have been similar. I might have thought, well, how my able to know if this is safe. 
J
Jeff Min
01:08:03
I appreciate that feedback. Yeah. That is also one of the things that we are unfortunately still trying to solve in terms of building that trust. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:08:14
Yeah. Definitely. Oh, I know it must be hard. 
J
Jeff Min
01:08:18
Okay, I just have two last questions. How? I mean. If this was the app that you are going to use, let's say you have it on your phone, would you be going through this type of exercise where you go through transactions and rate them. How frequently would you do it? Would it be a monthly exercise? Would it be a weekly one? Or would it be a daily one? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:08:46
I think when I first got the app, I would sit and do it for the past month like we just did. But going forward. I don't think I would remember to do it every day. I might do it every day if I got an automatic notification that was like. Tag the purchase you just made. And I just clicked a button on the notification or on the app. But I don't think I would tag things at the end of the day. I think maybe the end of the week, but not daily or monthly. 
J
Jeff Min
01:09:21
Gotcha. What would be the right time to nudge you a little bit? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:09:30
I was kind of thinking right after the transaction is made. And then I would probably just let it sit in my notifications as a reminder and then do it later. Or so I would say either like you get the notification for each individual thing right after it happens or one notification at the end of the day that wraps everything up. 
J
Jeff Min
01:09:56
Right. So a little exercise that you do late in the evening when you have some time. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:10:02
Yeah, because that's probably what I would end up doing with the individual notifications anyways. 
J
Jeff Min
01:10:07
Gotcha. Gotcha. Would you ever want Peak to tell you how much you can spend a day? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:10:18
Just going back to the other question real quick from before. 
J
Jeff Min
01:10:21
Oh, yeah, sure. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:10:22
I also think if the notification did come like once a day, varying the time at which it comes would be really good. Because I do have. I have an app that has sent me a notification at 4pm every day for years. And like, I haven't deleted the app, but I never use it because I know when my phone buzzes at 4pm that it's that app. So that's just an aside. 
J
Jeff Min
01:10:44
Like a 4pm clock. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:10:46
Yeah, exactly. So if it could be like, oh, 6:37 or oh, today it came at 8pm or something, I think that could be cool. And if it could give me a budget for the day, I feel like for me that's not as feasible because I don't have. Like predictable expenses right now. But I think I would use it more if I thought, okay, I'm going on a weekend trip. Like, how much could I spend on my weekend trip? 
J
Jeff Min
01:11:20
Or right. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:11:24
Even, like, I could see if I'm anxious, like, if I'm at a thrift store and I feel like I have a ton of stuff in my cart and I'm feeling anxious about how much money I can spend. Maybe like, consulting peak for that would be good. But on a daily basis for, like, my lifestyle, I don't think that would help as much. But if I had a more set routine, I think that would be good. 
J
Jeff Min
01:11:52
Okay. I think that was all the questions that I had. Let me just review my notes. Yeah, Actually, that was it. Yeah. Thank you so much for taking the time. If you have questions, I would love to answer them, if you have any. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:12:14
When did you all start making this app? 
J
Jeff Min
01:12:18
Through different variations and pivots, it's been about a year. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:12:22
Okay, cool. 
J
Jeff Min
01:12:23
So what you're seeing now is almost like the fourth iteration of the product. This looks nothing like the current version on the App Store. The current version on the App Store also looked nothing like what we have, like three months ago. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:12:38
I see. Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
01:12:40
Yeah. It was a very light app with dark text, which many people find difficult and hard to read, like you said. So that's how we ended up with this deep, purplish, mysterious, cosmic thing, so to speak. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:12:59
Yeah, yeah. I do like the purple for that reason. 
J
Jeff Min
01:13:01
Yeah, I see that. Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:13:04
And it also feels less. Like, readable for people who are looking at your phone. I don't know. I feel like black text on a white screen. Like for financial stuff. Maybe people wouldn't like that. It feels like other people could read it more easily from afar. 
J
Jeff Min
01:13:22
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:13:23
Yeah. Okay, cool. 
J
Jeff Min
01:13:26
If you want to delete your data, by the way, you can do it now. I know, I know. Yeah. You care about privacy, so I just wanted to point that out. You can just. Yeah. Reset data and it's gone. Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:13:38
Okay, cool. I do appreciate that. 
J
Jeff Min
01:13:41
Yeah, no worries. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:13:43
And what's the. Is there. Is this the seven day study or have things changed? 
J
Jeff Min
01:13:51
Well, we've been doing this for about three weeks in seven days print. So each week we'll just basically interview a bunch of people. The rhythm so far has been that we interview. By the way, I'm in Singapore, so I'm on a different time zone. So what would typically happen is Sherry would interview some people in her time. And then when I wake up, I'll turn some interviews and then I'll do an iteration on the app demo and then we'll do the next round. Right. Until we got. We get answers to the things that we want to ask. Things we want to figure out and then we move on. So it's been about three weeks so far. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:14:31
Cool. Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
01:14:33
Yeah. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:14:34
And then I guess, like, what's the. I think that they messaged me saying that this was gonna. They were gonna send me notifications for seven days or something. Do you know if that's for this study? 
J
Jeff Min
01:14:46
Yeah, yeah, no. So it's probably updated now. So that was one of the things that we're going to test, but that is not the case anymore. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:14:53
Okay, Sounds good. Yeah. All right. 
J
Jeff Min
01:14:57
Actually, that's. So sorry, I will have to ask this question since primed about that. Would you have mind if like Peak was like messaging you instead of sending you notifications? It literally is sending you like imessages. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:15:19
I don't think I would mind. I don't know. I feel like I get a lot of like I'm signed up for some like political text messaging things and stuff. Those kind of bother me. I feel like it would be more effective if it was coming from the app, I have to say. 
J
Jeff Min
01:15:35
Okay. And with that consulting Peak thing, would you prefer imessage over the app or the app over imessage? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:15:46
Oh. I feel like maybe like imessage would be more convenient. 
J
Jeff Min
01:15:55
Right. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:15:56
Like if I'm going out and about. Yeah. But either would work. I don't think it would be a big problem. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:16:03
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
01:16:03
Okay. Appreciate that. Okay. Yeah. That's just a random question I had. Okay. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:16:09
Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
01:16:10
Any more from you? Any more questions for me? 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:16:15
I think they said I had to sign a contract or something or. 
J
Jeff Min
01:16:19
No, that is okay. I don't think it's needed, but I think there are some mentioning about gift cards and etc. We will process that most likely in the middle of coming week. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:16:33
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
01:16:33
Because we have to clear this batch and then we'll process it. And I believe our admin is going to be processing that through the platform home college. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:16:43
Okay, cool. 
J
Jeff Min
01:16:44
Yeah. If you have not received it yet, please do feel free to message me or Sherry. Yeah. Don't feel bad about it. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:16:51
Okay, Cool. Awesome. Well, this was fun. I wish you guys best on this and I will be keeping track of Peak in the future. 
J
Jeff Min
01:17:01
Awesome. Thank you. 
L
Liv Bjorgum
01:17:04

Thank you very much, Jeff. Goodbye.
