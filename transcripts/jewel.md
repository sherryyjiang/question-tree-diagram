Yes. Can you hear me? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:01
Hi. Yes. Hi. 
J
Jewel
00:04
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:04
Jewel, right? 
J
Jewel
00:05
Yes, Hi. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:06
How are you? 
J
Jewel
00:08
Good. How are you doing? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:10
Well, I guess it's Merry Christmas Eve. I just realized the. 
J
Jewel
00:15
The day. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:15
Thanks for still. I hope it's still okay time, by the way. 
J
Jewel
00:20
Yeah, that's fine. I know. I realized it after, too, so I was hoping that it still works for you, but. Oh, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:26
No, it's cool. It's full. 
J
Jewel
00:27
Yeah, no worries. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:29
All good. Where are you. Where are you based? 
J
Jewel
00:32
I'm in Orange county, so. Like, Southern California. So it's actually raining super hard today. Usually it's like, sunny. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:41
Oh, okay. I was gonna be. I actually lived in Orange county for a summer and. 
J
Jewel
00:45
Oh, really? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:46
I don't remember. It's. It didn't rain too much. 
J
Jewel
00:51
It usually doesn't. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:52
Yeah, yeah. 
J
Jewel
00:54
Where are you located? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:56
So I kind of stay between San Francisco Bay Area and then actually Asia. So I'm in Asia right now, actually, which is a slightly different time. 
J
Jewel
01:07
But, yeah, it's really early there. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:11
I'm an early person, so it's totally fine. Yeah. Well, it's nice to meet you, Jewel. I'm Sherry. And, you know, thanks for taking the time with us. So, just a little bit of background. I'm doing research for a company called Peak. We're basically. Basically trying to understand how people who are, you know, in school or few years out of school are kind of making decisions to kind of transition into, like, adulthood and, you know, especially around things like money. So the purpose of this chat is to first, you know, ask some questions to get understanding about you. And then I'll also show you an app that we're building as well to just get used. Get some feedback from you. 
J
Jewel
01:54
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:55
And just. Just remember that everything. There's no right or wrong answer. Just like, say what's on your mind. 
J
Jewel
02:01
Sounds good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:02
All right, awesome. Well, I'll just kick things off with a, you know, simple question. Just tell me a little bit more about yourself. So you live in Orange County. 
J
Jewel
02:11
When. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:11
When did you graduate? What are you up to? 
J
Jewel
02:13
Yeah, all of that, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So I graduated from UCLA in 2022, which is kind of crazy. It's been like three years now. Yeah, I know. Which is so wild. But, yeah, I graduated and then I moved back to Orange county, which is where I've been, because after that I got a job at J and J, which is. The office is in Irvine. So it's really close. Close to home and stuff. So I've been there for, like, ever since I graduated and I guess a little bit about that role. It's. It's in regulatory affairs. So I'm specifically in like, the med. Med devices sector. And in reg affairs, we work with, like, the FDA to get approval for the medical devices that. That R and D creates. It's a really cool job. 
J
Jewel
03:04
I didn't really know about it when I was in college, but luckily I was able to do like an internship and, you know, kind of found myself here. So. Yeah, that's kind of who I am, I guess, and what I do. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:18
What did you study when you were in school? 
J
Jewel
03:21
Good question. Yeah, I actually did biochem, which I know with that usually people kind of go the pre health track. And I. I actually wanted to go into optometry school at the time, but then it was like, during COVID I was really tired of school and then, you know, like, I just. It was kind of like I had. I had the opportunity to take this role, which would have been like a net positive decision versus going to more schools. So I ended up pivoting away from that route. Yeah. So biochem was. Was what my major was. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:54
Yeah. And how are you? I guess. So it's been three years, right? 
J
Jewel
03:57
@ J and J. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:58
Yeah. Yeah. How has that. 
J
Jewel
04:01
Been? Yeah, it's awesome. Honestly, I really enjoy it because it's like a hybrid position, so I get to go into office like two times a week, and then the rest of the time I'm working from home, which is really nice.  Yeah, I feel like I learn a lot there and it's kind of like an unexpected venture, I guess, but I really enjoy it and it's a great company. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:24
So. Yeah. And how's, like, living in, like, moving back home to Orange county versus, like, a. 
J
Jewel
04:32
Student? Yeah. So I actually. I don't know if I liked la. Like, it was. It was definitely a different vibe, but it was it like there. It's like if you want to go anywhere, like, you have to, like, there's no guarantee of parking. Right. Like here if you go somewhere, like. And I'm used to, like, driving around everywhere. Like, I'm not a public transportation person. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, it was nice to be able to come back. I feel like Orange county is where, you know, I thrive and I like it here. I think the vibes are just different than la, for sure. Even though it's really expensive to live here. But I. I like it better than la, for. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:12
Sure. Yeah, for sure. And I guess, like, how did you. What were some of the things that you did to kind of like, I guess set up your like, life transition, like living in Orange County. Like, I'm sure it's a little bit different than, you know, when you were in high. 
J
Jewel
05:27
School. Yeah, no, for sure. And for me, like, I'm really lucky because, like, my parents, like, early on kind of instilled like, you know, saving money and all of those, like, principles, I guess, in me. Obviously, you know, I knew that, but I didn't really, like, listen, but as. As I kind of like grew older, I feel like once you graduate from college and you're kind of living on your own and you're making like, you know, adult money or whatever, you. You're like, oh, wait, like, I should start, you know, thinking about, like, what my finances look like. I think for me, half of me was kind of like, oh my gosh, I need to like, save money and stuff because, like, living expenses. 
J
Jewel
06:07
But then also half of me was like, I think mostly the first year I was like, oh my gosh, I'm making like adult money. So, like, it's like so much money. Like, I have so much money to, like, work with. So I think it was kind of like a half and half where like half me was like, oh, I should be responsible, but the other half of me was like, well, I can like, do so much more now. But in terms of like, setting myself up, I don't think there's like, a right way of doing it. I kind of just like, did what my parents told me or like what I read online or like what people kind of said to do. And you know, with that, it was like the whole. 
J
Jewel
06:47
There's like the rule where like, you should do like 80, 20 or something, like, most of your money should be going to savings and then the rest for like. Well, at the time when I first, like, graduated, I was living at home, so I didn't really have a lot of expenses. So I was trying to put as much of it into savings as possible. I have like a high yield savings account. And then obviously with like, the job, like, there's 401ks to contribute to and things like that. So I kind of just learned as I go. And obviously I'm not like amazing at it. I'm still like, learning and seeing what else I can do. But I would say that's how I started off, I guess, in the beginning to kind of help set myself. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:31
Up. Yeah, when you said that you learned a few things online, like, what were some of those. 
J
Jewel
07:36
Sources? Oh, that's a good question. I feel like I. I want to say it was just like social media, like, just like TikTok or like Instagram, where people will be like, hey, let me tell you, like, you should have a Roth ira. You should have this. And some of these things. It was like, my parents had already told me, and it kind of just reinforced that I was on the right track, I guess. But I do think that. And I know everyone's like, situation finances are different. So it's like, hard to have like a one track, like, oh, this is the blueprint. 
J
Jewel
08:10
But I think it would have been nice, you know, back then to have like, I don't know, like a dedicated or like some sort of resource that I could go and be like, oh, like, I have this, this, like, what should I be doing? I guess I think that would have been helpful. But yeah, a lot of it was just like online social media and then just listening to other. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:34
People. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's good that you seem, like, pretty deliberate about like, at least trying to figure out, like, how to do it the right way. And I'm wondering, like, what did you learn is actually worth spending money on in, like, the last three. 
J
Jewel
08:49
Years? You mean, like in terms of self? Oh, okay. So, yeah, I think in terms of like, what is worth. And this is honestly, like, something that's like, it varies for everyone too. But I think for me it was things that I prioritized. So, like, for example, like, I know some people might spend a lot of money on like, clothes and stuff, but for me, I was like, well, I want to make sure that I have enough money for like, retirement and like, savings, emergency fund, but any extra it would probably go towards, like, travel or like buying, I don't know, like, things that I like. I don't really have like a specific, like, I guess thing that I like buying, but I think majority is like travel and then like, eating out is a big one. 
J
Jewel
09:39
I feel like that's something that's like. I also was like, I really want to make sure I have enough for that. And I'm not just like scrambling for money, I guess. So I think those two would be my biggest, like, expenses for like, wants. But again, I think that's just like, based on as I went through, I was like, this is what I prioritize and this is what I. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:02
Like. Yeah, and how. How about things that you realized you thought you would enjoy or like, thought it was worth spending the money, but later on you felt like, regret or that's not really worth. Worth. 
J
Jewel
10:19
It. Oh, for sure, Yeah. I mean, well, when I first, like, graduated and stuff, I think I was very, like, I was more careless with my sending. Like, it was like, oh, like, I want to get something to eat outside, so I'll just do that. And then like, you don't realize that, like, it adds up. And it's not that I regret it. It's more like. I think it was like, it was just. It has to be done in moderation, I guess. So I think some of those I was like, oh, I could have, you know, packed a lunch instead and, you know, save that money or like, you know, grabbing like a matcha or something or like a drink, like a fun drink. And you're like, well, it was worth it in the moment. But also like, you could make those drinks, like, yeah. 
J
Jewel
10:59
By yourself. There have been a lot of, like, impulse purchases, for sure. Like, I, I get, like, I. I get. I guess that's the word. Like, I really like limited edition things. I'm like a marketer. Like, marketing teams. Like, it's really bad if they put limited edition. That usually, like, you know, gets me. And so there have been times where, you know, the hype of like, trying to get something that isn't, like, hard to get usually gets me. And then I'm like, that shouldn't have been a purchase. So I would say things like that. And like, that was towards. More towards the beginning. And then as, like, as I kind of progressed and like saw like my money growing and the amount of money I was saving, I think I became more conscious about like, spending. 
J
Jewel
11:53
Like, I would think about it beforehand because I liked watching my money grow. And then this year, earlier this year, I ended up purchasing a condo. So this year I've been really like, you know, like, trying to like, obviously it's really hard because, like, there are times where I still. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:11
Like. 
J
Jewel
12:11
Yeah. But I've been really trying to like, be more conscious about that. So I would just say a lot of the impulse spends, like on like extra miscellaneous things that sound good in the moment, but then afterwards you're like, this isn't really a smart decision. I think those would be like, the big. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:30
Regrets. Yeah, that's super interesting when you said like, limited edition stuff, like, what were some of those kind of things, if you even a specific thing you. 
J
Jewel
12:43
Bought. Yeah, so I think in the beginning I was doing like, dunks, like Nike dunks, like the shoes. So a lot of like, shoes, like, they'd be like, oh, there's a drop at like 7am or something. And the words like, drop, I was like, oh, my God, I have to get this. It would be like, yeah, it'd be like that. Or like, so I. Disney, I think they have a lot of, like, limited edition, like, oh, like stuffed animals or, like, plushies. Like, that was also a big thing. And then I think, honestly, a lot of, like, the mini things, like, companies will come out with, like, mini versions of things, and it's like, oh, limited edition drop. Like, those would also get me.  yeah, those are, like, the big ones I can think. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:34
Of. Yeah. Where were you following some of these. 
J
Jewel
13:37
Drops? Oh, my gosh. Definitely Instagram. I think there were, like, pages that would, like, post about it or, like, discord groups. Yeah, yeah. Or like, I mean, just like, the. The. The Nike sneakers app would, like, tell you which ones are coming up. And then, like, I would search like, oh, like, what's cool about this? Like, I don'. I was just, like, looking on social media, I. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:04
Think. Yeah, got it. And it's interesting that you know, categorize these as, like, impulse and that is decided is not something that was worth it. Like, what made you, like, what was the thought process? Like, what made you feel like. Because sometimes you just buy nice and it's okay, right? But, like, clearly there's something that went through your head where you're like, oh, like, why did I do. 
J
Jewel
14:30
That? So, like, yeah, no, I think some things when you impulse buy, like, you can justify it afterwards. You're like, you know, like, this was actually a good purchase. I think with the shoes, it was like, maybe one or two would have been fine, but, like, I think I ended up with, like, at least 10 pairs. And they're all the same, like. Yeah, they're all the same, like, design, just different colors. Right. And I'm like, I don't need, like, I wear, like, maybe, like, two or three pairs of shoes, and I, like, cycle out from, like, I, you know, interchange between those. But, like, a lot of them, honestly, to this day, are still sitting there. So it's kind of just like. 
J
Jewel
15:08
Yeah, so it's kind of just like, oh, well, like, the money just went into that and then, like, never really came out or got anything from it. Yeah, for. Yeah, for, like, the Disney plushies, too. Like, those, you know, when you're there, it feels like, oh, my God, like, this is so cool. Like, it's such a cool purchase. But then at the end of the day, it's like, they're cute, but also, like, what function does it bring for you. Because they kind of just sit there. Like it doesn't really, I guess add any value. So that's why I would categorize those as more like impulse buys that like could have been. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:45
Avoided. Got it, got. So you're almost like the, I guess the, for the plushie, specifically the projected utility or joy that you would for them did not match like what the actual reality is. Yeah, yeah, got it. And like it's interesting with the sneakers you're like, okay, like I got 10 pairs, very similar design color. I look at them and I'm like, wow. I only use 2 to 3. Like for the plushies. Like at what degree where you're like, wow, that's a lot. Like, was it like 10 of. 
J
Jewel
16:12
Them? Yeah, I mean, so my couch, like literally it's like an L shaped couch. So like I sit one. Like the other part is literally all plushies. And like, I think that's when I was like, this is a problem. So yeah, I don't know, it's like probably 10 to 20. Yeah, like you said, like there's a lot. And it's because like it's the ones I've bought plus like ones that people have gifted to me that I'm just like, well, I don't know what to do with these because like, I don't want to like, you know, get rid of them. But also like, they really just are for decoration. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:47
Purposes. Yeah, got it. 
J
Jewel
16:50
No. Thanks for. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:51
Sharing. Now actually going back to the lunch, spending one. What like I went through your head that made you feel like, oh, you know, this is adding up. Like, what's adding up mean that like, yeah. Packing your. 
J
Jewel
17:06
Lunch. Yeah. So I think like at least in the beginning, like when I first graduated, because I think in high school I had one of like one of those credit cards that was like connected to my banks account. So yeah, I wasn't as conscious because I was just like, you know, and like my mom had made comments like, hey, like it's a lot. Like it's getting a lot. But I never like, it didn't really like hit me because for me like the, you know, back then the concept of money wasn't like. Yeah. So I think in college, you know, I kind of continued that, but it was with my own money because I was doing like internships and like working while I was in college. 
J
Jewel
17:49
So I always had like the funding for it and I didn't really think much of it because the money was enough and I didn't think about, like, oh, you know, I should be putting some of this away instead of spending it. I think it when, like, once I graduated from college and kind of like, migrated into this whole, like, living on my own and owning the property, like, obviously all the expenses add up. So I started realizing, like, hey, like, you know, these things. Like, yes, it's nice to go out every so often, but it's. It should be done in moderation because there are other expenses that are, like, more important and the money is not, like, endless. So I would say, like, because I was. I guess I was. I don't know how many times a week I was eating. 
J
Jewel
18:39
I would say, like, maybe like four times or like, almost like half to, like 80 of the week. So, yeah, it was like. Like, that obviously is, like, a. A good amount. So I think that's kind of when I started. I guess that was the. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:59
Trigger. 
J
Jewel
19:00
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:00
Okay. Got it, got it. Like, were you, like, looking at, like, your. Was it like, yeah, like, oh, I reflected on my week and the number of times I went out was the trigger, or did you, like, look at your. 
J
Jewel
19:12
Banks? No, I looked at my. Yeah, it was like, my credit card bill, and then I was like, oh, like, that's actually a lot. Because when you're swiping, like, you don't really. Especially with, like, Apple Pay now, it's like, yeah, you just happen. You. It doesn't really feel like you're spending money. And then when you look at, like, you know, the bank statement, the credit card statement, that's when, like, you kind of are like, oh. So I think it was definitely the credit card like, the. The posting and being like, hey, you spend this much, and then seeing the total, like, outstanding. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:40
Balance. Yeah, yeah, got it. Would you be able to recall, like, your thought process as well? So you saw the total balance. Then, like, what were the. Like, what did. Where did your brain go, like. 
J
Jewel
19:51
Each step when you're. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:52
Like. To the point where you're like, okay, that's. That's. That's a. 
J
Jewel
19:55
Lot. I think. I think for me, it was like I was looking. I was like. Because for me, I was always like, I'm never gonna. Like, I will always pay off my credit card bill, like, you know, in full. Like, I never want to do, like, where it's, like, overdue or whatever. So I think when I looked at it once and I always made sure, like, my checking had enough to cover whatever. Like, the checking number should be bigger than the credit card balance number. I think there was One, like a couple times where it was like, not that. And so I was like, okay, like, where am I going to find the money to, like. Like, I have to, like, move money around between, like, accounts or something. And I was like, this. This is not good. So I think it was that. 
J
Jewel
20:39
That kind of triggered that line of. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:40
Thinking. Got it. So there was almost like a wake up call moment where you're like, oh, this is breaking a principle that I set out, which is like, you should always have more on your checking account. Yeah. And you're like, well, that's not happening. So, like, something needs to change. 
J
Jewel
20:54
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I think so. Yeah. But I would say it wasn't like that happened. But at the time I was kind of like, you know, it's fine because, like, I didn't really have many other bills because I was living at home. But I think it was not until like this year when, you know, this big purchase of the condo, like, really, like, cemented like that actually, like, put me into action. Like, I was like, I actually have to now because, yeah, you know, like, it. Otherwise I'd be screwed. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:25
Yeah. No, that makes sense. You said something interesting earlier. You were like, oh, like, why am I spending on food this amount when there are other expenses that are more important or those. There's obviously condo payment, right? I'm guessing. Yeah. Mortgage. Besides, like, the mortgage, like, was there anything else where you're like, oh, like, this is more important and I don't want to feel like this is. Food is trading off with. 
J
Jewel
21:52
That. No, I think when I said that I was thinking about the. The mortgage. I think if we're looking. Yeah. If we're looking at just like back then, I would say, because I lived at home and I wasn't really paying, like, rent or anything. Like, like, food was like, eating out was my biggest expense. And so it wasn't like, oh, like there's something more important, I guess, because I. I would make sure I would have at least a little something for like extensions that might pop up out of nowhere. But I would say that statement is more applicable to now where it's like the boarding utilities, like, bills, like all the things that, like, come with this. Yeah. That, like, I didn't expect. 
J
Jewel
22:41
So it's more like a conscious, like, oh, maybe I should not be, you know, splurging on food when there's, like, things that I actually need to like, realize, like, things that I need to. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:53
Yeah. Yeah. And how did that make you feel? Like, did you feel like you really missed that freedom to spend or you're kind of like, wait, it wasn't really that necessary in the beginning. So glad that I made the. 
J
Jewel
23:06
Change. I would say, I think compared to how I was operating in the beginning, like in college or like when I first graduated, there are definitely moments where I'm like, I could have not like, bought food outside. It was more just like a, you know, it's easy and it was there and I just caved in. But there, I will say, like, obviously, like, there is like some sadness where I'm like, oh, you know, like, I can't be eating out every single day. But I will say, like, I still will treat myself and go out sometimes. Like, it's not like I'm just never doing that, but I think it's helped me be more conscious of which ones are worth it. I guess, like, if it was like, you know, I'm not just casually like, dropping money on certain foods. 
J
Jewel
24:00
It's just one that, like, I actually really want to eat. I don't know if that makes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:06
Sense. Yeah, no, that makes sense. And did you have like, regular spots that you would like to go. 
J
Jewel
24:12
To? Yeah, I would say fast food is like, like in and out or like the ones that are like, easy and like taste good. I feel like those would be the ones that are most common. But I also like, love shabu and like. Well, yeah, those kind of restaurants. I feel like those also add up. But even like on top of that, like, I feel like with especially oc, like hanging out with friends, it's very much like food oriented. So it's like whenever you meet up with someone, it's usually like getting coffee or drinks or like food. So like, those also added up. 
J
Jewel
24:48
So I think part of that is kind of like now I kind of am like, well, I should only give myself like a sweet treat or like eating out when I'm hanging out with friends instead of like just grabbing that like by myself at, I don't know, for like a meal. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:05
So. Yeah, yeah, no, that makes sense. So it's almost like you made the realization that the value of spending money on food is more so for like connecting with people and spending time with them. But if it was like, oh, I just bought this as a treat for myself, I don't need to treat myself to the level that I was doing it. I could do it originally, but like, most of the time I don't need. 
J
Jewel
25:29
To. Yeah, because it'll be like, there's Ice cream at home or like, which there is like, it's like, it's Haagenaz ice cream. It's good ice cream. It's not. It doesn't have to be like, you know, salt and straw or like whatever ice cream outside that there is. So I think it's more. Yeah, like you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:45
Said. Yeah. Sultan straw is really good.

Though. Yeah. You know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:52
Yeah. No, thanks for sharing. And I, I. One thing I was kind of curious about is when you bought your condo, was that the first time you moved out of home to live in the condo you bought, there was not like a period where you were renting. 
J
Jewel
26:07
Right. So, no, yeah, it was all at once. And actually the reason I did that was because I didn't want to pay rent. I felt like I was like, if I'm gonna, like, especially because right here is so expensive, I was like, you know, I'd rather just suffer a little longer, I guess, and then, you know, at least put the money towards, like, I guess, myself versus like giving it to like Irvine Co. Or something like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:37
That. Yeah, got it. That makes sense. So basically you did a little bit of like the math or the thinking and you're like, you know what? Like, rent's already so expensive. I might as well just like the money that would have gone towards it. I can build up some home. 
J
Jewel
26:52
Equity. Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:54
Yeah. I was going to say that it's a pretty dramatic change, I'm sure, because some people usually they go to like, you know, they go from parents house and then they start renting and then you went. Yeah, also like, boom. Down payment and like a. 
J
Jewel
27:08
Mortgage. Yeah. And it was a lot like, I mean, it still is like, it's like basically like my whole like, paycheck. And so that part is obviously like, very daunting. But I was like, you know, why not take this risk while my parents are still, you know, in the area and around. So like, if something were to just like go exponentially wrong, you know, hopefully, like, I can at least come back from it while I'm still young. So that was kind of the logic or reasoning. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:40
There. Yeah, got it. But yeah, that's pretty, it's pretty incredible to like get there like in your, like. 
J
Jewel
27:50
Mid-20S. So, I mean, I'm hoping. Thank you. But I mean, it's still, it's still early, so I'm hoping it like, you know, levels out. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:00
Hopefully. Yeah, for sure. I realized we spent a lot of time talking. We haven't had time to go to the prototype, but I mean, that is okay. I. I was going to say. Well, first of all, thank. 
J
Jewel
28:19
You. Yeah, I was gonna say we could also, if you need to do like another call, another time, I can also do that just to go like, if you want to do the second. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:29
Part. Yeah, yeah, let's do that. Okay. I think you have been arranging this through Yash, if I'm not. 
J
Jewel
28:38
Mistaken. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:39
Yeah. Okay. I'll just message him instead of. If we set this only up for 30 minutes, we'll also make sure that the other 30 minutes. We'll make sure to compensate you for that. No, for sure. Just because normally we spend like 15 minutes. But like, I was. 
J
Jewel
28:54
Just. Sorry, I. I talk a. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:55
Lot. Don't. Don't apologize at all. It was super. It was super interesting and I think the. You buying your house, you know, recently is also like something that I found really interesting and just wanted. 
J
Jewel
29:10
To. Look. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:11
Don'T. Don't apologize for like being helpful, but that's actually it. In terms of my immediate questions now, is there anything else that you think would be interesting to share about, like, I guess, your view or your emotions or things you're thinking about with money. 
J
Jewel
29:28
Before? Yeah, I don't think so. I feel like. I feel like I kind of. I hope, I guess I conveyed what my. My stance on it is, but if I think of anything else, I can bring it up in our. In our next call as. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:42
Well. Okay, sounds good. Well, Jewel, thank you so much. Merry Christmas and I'll talk to you. 
J
Jewel
