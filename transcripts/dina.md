Dina Bressler: 00:00 
 Oh, hi, Dina. Hi. Sorry, the lighting is like, not the best.

Sherry Jiang: 00:40 
 Oh, no, don't apologize at all. And thanks for. Thanks for waiting. My last meeting just like, ran over, so thanks for. Thanks for your patience.

Dina Bressler: 00:51 
 Yeah, all good. No problem.

Sherry Jiang: 00:54 
 Where are. Where are you currently based out of?

Dina Bressler: 00:57 
 So I'm in New York, actually.

Sherry Jiang: 00:59 
 Oh, okay. All right. It's like 8:00pm your time, right?

Dina Bressler: 01:03 
 It is 8:00pm, yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 01:05 
 Okay, cool, Cool. Are you from New York originally or you move there like.

Dina Bressler: 01:09 
 No, I'm not a transplant.

Sherry Jiang: 01:11 
 I belong here. Okay, very cool. That's awesome. I love New York. I was just back there in November. Hope to go sometime again, but it's a great city.

Dina Bressler: 01:23 
 Yeah, it's freezing right now, so I don't know where you're at, but stay there.

Sherry Jiang: 01:28 
 Yeah, I'm a California person, so. But I mean, it's. All right. Well, cool. I know we have just like a little less than 50 minutes, so I'll try to be concise with the intro and just get into things. I'm Sherry. I'm doing research for Peak. We're a startup and we're looking to understand how young professionals are making decisions, especially around money and using that to hopefully build a product that is more empathetic and more kind of in tune with like, I guess, money situation for this current generation. And this interview will be in two parts. The first part will be just a series of questions for me to, like, get to know you, how you make money decisions in your own life. And the second part we're going to run through a semi pseudo app experience. It's going to be done on ChatGPT, so I'll just send you the prompts and stuff to go through with that. I'll get the instructions there when we get to that stage. Any questions before we get started?

Dina Bressler: 02:35 
 Nope.

Sherry Jiang: 02:36 
 Awesome. Okay, well, tell me more about yourself. So you're like a New York native.

Dina Bressler: 02:42 
 Where, like, what are you.

Sherry Jiang: 02:43 
 What are you doing, I guess for living right now with your time? What do you like to do for fun? Like, what's your age? Like, all that basic detail?

Dina Bressler: 02:53 
 Yeah. Okay. So my name is Dina. I'm a registered nurse. I started off at the bedside and then actually migrated into a leadership position. That was about three years now. So I went from bedside to an assistant manager and now I'm in a manager role. Um, I actually went back for my master's and instead of just getting like a master's in leadership, I also got an MBA because I think healthcare is evolving more to be a business. So I wanted that Background. I think for me growing up, like, I never really knew how to manage finances, things like that. And it was always just like, oh well, like I don't know, it's like not my problem to figure out. And then I think like, as I've become, you know, more into adulthood and I'm like, okay, I'm making money, I need to know what, what I'm doing with it. And I think also now I'm managing like a hospital budget, like I'm managing a lot of money for other people. It's not a flex to not know how to spend your own money and like what you're doing with it. So I think for me, like that's just a little context around my career and things like that. I'm also like Gen Z. So it's very interesting in the workplace working with all different generations and how people have this opinion, I think of like millennials and Gen Z. So that's been interesting too because especially like in a leadership role, I'm always the youngest in a room. So that's always. I take everything like very personal when they kind of like attack the younger generations because I'm like, wait, wait, as the defense person here, like, I need to represent. So. Yeah, that's just like a little bit about me.

Sherry Jiang: 04:21 
 Yeah, yeah. Do you, do you mostly work with folks that are like, I don't want to say older, but like, you know, older? I guess like 40s and 50s.

Dina Bressler: 04:31 
 I think now, like, you know, we've had a lot of turnover, so now I'm getting like younger nurses. And actually I'm getting probably like 22 to 25 year olds. Like that's a lot of the nurses, which is crazy because you go to a hospital and you're like, these are kids. I think I've worked with like a very much like 40s, 50s, like people who are homeowners and have children and have like real responsibilities. And then now I'm like all of a sudden back to like with people who are like, oh, I've never lived out of my parents house. So it's interesting to see that.

Sherry Jiang: 05:04 
 Yeah, for sure. And what, what, what made you go into like nursing in the first place? Like what sparked that?

Dina Bressler: 05:11 
 I think for me I was looking for a career that I would get fulfillment out of because I didn't just like, I wanted to do something that would feel rewarding. So I was, I was very drawn to nursing because I felt like that was at the forefront, able to help people. And then once I entered into nursing, I've Just naturally always gravitated towards leadership roles. And I think for me, you know, when you, like, complain about things, you're like, okay, so do it better. I was like, you know what? I think I can, and I could make an impact that's greater than just the patience I'm seeing. So I think that's kind of what led me to take that next step.

Sherry Jiang: 05:44 
 Got it, got it. And you. You said something interesting earlier that you're like, okay, now that I'm, like, running budgets here and, like, getting that stuff together, I'm, like, starting to think about it, like, for my own life. So can you, like, describe a little bit about, like, your own background with, like, managing money and, like, what were some of the challenges or things that you, like, didn't know, you didn't know and, like, what you're navigating, like, right now?

Dina Bressler: 06:09 
 Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, growing up, I wasn't, like, taught how to, like, economics just wasn't a thing. So I think I always just thought, like, you saved up, you bought a house. Like, I didn't realize your money could make money. I didn't realize you're supposed to, like, invest it. I remember I felt, like, so mature when I was thinking about, like, retirement. I'm like, whoa, I'm in my 20s. I'm, like, thinking ahead. So for me, I was very naive. Like, I didn't know anything. And I think now. Now the more I go into it, like, I'm not. So I'm not an expert at all, but I think it's. Yeah, like, it's not. It's something that's not taught about enough, and you kind of have to, like, learn on the job. And I find, like, even amongst, you know, my peers, and we're all in our upper 20s, we're all discussing, like, did you know this? I didn't know this. Like, I remember one person, she was telling me that, I think, like, late in the year, they sent her some sort of email about 401B. And so she's like, yeah, I just did the max contribution, and I didn't make any paycheck this week. I'm like, yeah, because you put it all into your retirement. Like, you need to do it gradually. And I. I had to, like, call people, be like, how much is a normal percentage to put? Like, what makes sense? So I think budgets and stuff. Like, that was. Was interesting, that learning curve. Like, you get your first paycheck, and you're like, where did it go?

Sherry Jiang: 07:26 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. It's like, we're, like, taught all these, like, things growing up in school, but then, like, life skills just, like, are things that were kind of thrown into the deep end about. It's like, o. Okay, now you're an adult. Like, figure it out. You're like, where's the playbook for this?

Dina Bressler: 07:40 
 Right.

Sherry Jiang: 07:40 
 Where do we.

Dina Bressler: 07:41 
 Yeah, absolutely.

Sherry Jiang: 07:42 
 Right.

Dina Bressler: 07:42 
 I wish I was. I'm like, I work in healthcare. I have to pay for insurance. And it's like, yeah, you do.

Sherry Jiang: 07:48 
 Actually. Yeah. I never thought about that. But that. I thought I would have assumed that that would be, like, a benefit, I guess. But, like, yeah, I mean, I would have assumed.

Dina Bressler: 07:57 
 I pay very little. I've learned over time that, like, the amount I pay is marginal compared to everyone else. But, yeah, I was shocked. I was like, what? Like, we pay for this? This is crazy.

Sherry Jiang: 08:08 
 Yeah, for sure. When you first, like, got your paycheck, like, I guess a few years ago, and you were like, oh, my gosh, like, where's the money disappearing? Like, did you unearth or figure out any, like, habits that were not great spending habits that you had that you're like, oh, my gosh. Like, I can't believe I was doing this.

Dina Bressler: 08:29 
 I think for me, like, some people, they'll do, like, uber eats or they'll, like, spend on little things. I'm the type where I'll, like, go out one night and. And like, go big. And I think I've learned that I cannot do that so frequently because back when I was doing shifts, it would be like, you do your three shifts and especially night shift. Then I would have, like, a stretch of four days off. And I'm like, let's go out every night. And then I've learned, like, I can't afford that. I remember at one point I was going in for overtime. Cause I was like, I just won't spend money that way because it will make me, like, go to work and do something because otherwise I'm going out. This is great. So I think I've learned because in college, like, anytime you can go out and stop finals like you do when it's exciting and maybe what, like a week a semester here, you have a lot more free time. So you need to figure out, like, what you're going to spend in that free time.

Sherry Jiang: 09:14 
 Yeah. Is that. Was that, like, common, I guess, for, like, other folks working in, like, health care right after they graduate? Because I also imagine it's like, yeah, you work so hard, like, for a stretch of days, and like, you just need like a. I don't know. Release or like you want to go, like, do things like. Is that pretty common? You would say?

Dina Bressler: 09:34 
 Yeah, I think so. And it's also, if you can like stretch your shifts, you're like, wait, I can go on a vacation in between, you're like, wait, can I pay for this vacation? Like, it's. Yeah, it's. It's expensive. And I think especially New York is very expensive. Even just like rent itself is. It's extreme. Like sometimes I'm like, I just want to sit in my apartment and just enjoy the money I'm paying. Because it's expensive.

Sherry Jiang: 09:56 
 Yeah, for sure. And like what I. I guess what like did you end up doing then if you like, you know, limited the time that you like went out, like, you know, in between shifts, of course we still want to do things that are fun or like, you know, are relaxing. Like, have you found. Had. Had you found other ways to like decompress that, like, don't break your bank? I guess. Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 10:21 
 I think it's like I used to go a lot to spin class and then I got a peloton, which I find saves me a lot of money. I think it's like learning what you want to spend money on.

Sherry Jiang: 10:33 
 Excuse me.

Dina Bressler: 10:33 
 Versus like, like even eating out.

Sherry Jiang: 10:36 
 Like, I've had to change.

Dina Bressler: 10:37 
 I've had to change a lot of habits, I think.

Sherry Jiang: 10:40 
 Yeah. So like was eating out like kind of part of the, like going out, like habits you had? Okay, yeah, I'm sure it's expensive in New York.

Dina Bressler: 10:54 
 Yeah, it is. It's so expensive. And I think also it's. Yeah, it's like you have to reduce the frequency and you have to reduce. Like if you're gonna go big, then it can be like infrequent. If you want to like go get fast food, then you could do it more. Like it's, it's just about figuring those things out, I think.

Sherry Jiang: 11:11 
 Yeah. And for.

Dina Bressler: 11:13 
 Go on.

Sherry Jiang: 11:13 
 Sorry.

Dina Bressler: 11:15 
 No, no, I think it's just in general, like even just like concerts thing, like just figuring out because in New York there's always something, so you can always find something to spend money on. So I think it's about recognizing like what are the things that like, okay, I can do this or I can skip.

Sherry Jiang: 11:33 
 Yeah. And over time, like, what did you figure out, like, are your, I guess, like core priorities or things that you value and then how did you make those trade offs to be like, okay, this is what I value. Like, I can do it this way, but I don't have to do it like this. Like, you know, extra $200 way. And, like, what that kind of. I guess in between. That you landed on.

Dina Bressler: 11:59 
 Yeah. I think for me, vacationing was something I've learned to adjust. So I think I'm not. I don't love stopovers. I've learned, like, I've tried to save money by doing that. I'm miserable. I'm like, it's not worth it. Like, I'll pay the extra $300. I think I've learned, like, hotels that I don't need to necessarily stay in, like, the hot spot. I can do, like, Red eyes really well. Learning what within my budget I can do. I think that's been really helpful. And, like, I was saying, like, for example, like, the Taylor Swift concert, like, she came to New York. I didn't go. I'm not paying for that. I saw it in theaters. It was just as good. Like, there's always something happening. And I think I've learned how to, like, not have fomo, because I used to always feel like, no, but, like. Like, it's like, I want to be there. I want to be in those moments. And I think I've learned, like, no, there are, like, smaller versions of that, or you don't have to go to every single thing that ex. Because, again, especially in a city, you can always. There's always something you could be doing. There's always activity and action and stuff to spend money on.

Sherry Jiang: 13:04 
 Yeah. Yeah. And just figuring out, like, I guess, what the. What you need or, like, what the alternatives that you have available to, like, get the same satisfaction.

Dina Bressler: 13:13 
 Right.

Sherry Jiang: 13:15 
 I guess when it comes to, like, dining out, like, what did you figure out? Or dining. Eating out, going out, like, what did you figure out was, like, your balance? Because you talked about how, like, one way is, like, okay, if I really want to, like, you know, splurge and, like, have, like, a cool experience, I just have less frequency. But I'm like, I plan it for a particular day or you're like, you know what? Like, I don't. I want to do, like, these small eats throughout the week, these little treats, and that's what I want. Like, how did you.

Dina Bressler: 13:41 
 Like.

Sherry Jiang: 13:42 
 Yeah, like, what. What did you figure out was, like, what made you, like, the happiest? And, like, how did you figure.

Dina Bressler: 13:47 
 Yeah, I think that's what it is. I think it's about finding what is not going to make you miserable. Because if you're in a budget, you could know you could be miserable.

Sherry Jiang: 13:55 
 You're.

Dina Bressler: 13:55 
 Oh, my God, this sucks. My life is awful. So I think it's Just about figuring out like what works for you. For me, I've learned like I've picked up a lot of cooking skills and like pre meal prepping. I find that if I have stuff like I don't buy as much. So I think that's worked really well for me for during the week. I think for me, like I figured out that the weekends or like when I have a break from work, like for me, yeah, like, like a small eat out and then every once in a while doing something big, that's what will make me feel like, okay, I still go out and have a life, but it's not as often. So I think that works for me. I also, I think socially, like we like me and my friend, like we kind of all agreed like, yeah, we should probably start like cooking and like not being so bougie. So I think it became like a social thing too. So that's helped a lot because then we feel like grandmothers when we're like, oh, did you try this recipe? It's so good. It's quick, it's easy. You can make it after work. Like we become. And then I actually, I don't mind leftovers, so I've learned to like make a lot and then just like eat it throughout the week.

Sherry Jiang: 14:56 
 Yeah, yeah, for sure. It's, it's like you can get the same thing, you can get the same satisfaction from like, because like I guess like you can talk to your friends about things that are expensive hobbies or you're like, you know what, we're all kind of like trying to cook together and, or learn how to cook together and just like use that as a way to talk and connect as well.

Dina Bressler: 15:17 
 Yeah, exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 15:19 
 Yeah, for sure. And I guess when you think about like the last, I guess like most recent kind of spends.

Dina Bressler: 15:28 
 Right.

Sherry Jiang: 15:29 
 Was there something that you spent money on that you felt like you regretted or like didn't think was worth it?

Dina Bressler: 15:38 
 I'm trying to think because like usually it's worth it. I don't know, like, I love, I'm so bad because I'm like so pro consumerism. Like I buy clothes and stuff and I'm like, oh my gosh, it brings me such joy. Um, I think for me sometimes I'll go on Amazon and I'll be like, oh, let me try to get something that's gonna like save me. But like I think I was like an at home waxing kit and I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna do this. I'm henna my eyebrows and I'm gonna Like, wax it myself. I just, like, didn't work out the way I envisioned. So. Yeah, you know what? We're just gonna leave this for professionals. Like, this is not. I think I. I spent the equivalent on Amazon, as I probably would have just.

Sherry Jiang: 16:14 
 Just getting it done.

Dina Bressler: 16:15 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 16:16 
 Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 16:17 
 But it wasn't a regret. It wasn't a regret, though. It was inexperience.

Sherry Jiang: 16:21 
 Okay, got it, got it. Do you. Do you find yourself, like, trying these things, like, often, which is, like, I guess in a way it's, like, aspirational. It's like, oh, like, I want to, like, DIY like, more parts of my life, etc. Like, do you find yourself, like, doing this on Amazon, like, frequently or somewhere else frequently?

Dina Bressler: 16:41 
 I feel like recently, like, I've gotten into it. I feel like my for you page has recently become this. So I've started, like, trying random things. Yeah, this. This is very, very new. But one thing that I always was very into, and I think it's now trendy, which is funny. I've always thrifted, like, since high school. I think that's New York thing.

Sherry Jiang: 17:02 
 Yeah, got it. And. And do you go, like, how often do you go thrifting right now? Like, once a month or, like, once a week?

Dina Bressler: 17:12 
 Or I would say maybe, like, every other month. I don't go. Super, super.

Sherry Jiang: 17:17 
 Okay.

Dina Bressler: 17:18 
 Because I find that I do get a lot of things and I don't have the space for it. I think that's why I would. But I just don't have the space for it.

Sherry Jiang: 17:26 
 Yeah, got it, got it. And like, I guess, like, the.

Dina Bressler: 17:30 
 Do you.

Sherry Jiang: 17:30 
 Do you normally go with, like, an idea of what you want to get in mind, or you. You go just for the. I guess the experience of, like, digging through and, like, finding interesting stuff?

Dina Bressler: 17:39 
 I want to say it depends. So either I'll be like, okay, I need boots, and, like, that's the theme. Or I'll just go with, like, okay, it's winter. Like, let's see what winter stuff they have. So that's why I can't go so often, because if you don't come with, like, an exact thing, you end up just picking up everything. Oh, like, this is great. This is amazing. And I also. I love that, especially in the city, there's a lot of vintage places.

Sherry Jiang: 18:02 
 Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 18:03 
 It's so wide. So, yeah, that's been. But that I always did, like, the DIY stuff is more recent. Like, I'm like, what are they? Like, homesteading? Like, I'm like, I'm not. I'm not going to sit There making sourdough. But like, I'm starting to get into it. The thrifting I've always done.

Sherry Jiang: 18:20 
 Okay, gotcha. What made you. I guess, like, what's. What sparked this, like, new, like, I don't know if I call it a hobby. Maybe it is like this new interest in, like, home stuff.

Dina Bressler: 18:33 
 I think people just made it look really cool online. Yeah, it looks really fun. Like, they make it look fun and sometimes it's not fun, but sometimes they're like, oh, it's so cool. I made this myself, you know. Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 18:45 
 God. Oh. Like, so you be like, on, like, I don't know, Instagram or like TikTok and like, you can see people like, oh, like, that was really interesting and crafty. Or like, I want that too. Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 18:55 
 And it's also even. I don't know, I feel like maybe again, maybe I'm just getting older. Like, my for you page sometimes is people, like, cleaning and I'm like, that looks so satisfying. Like, when they organize, I'm like, I should organize.

Sherry Jiang: 19:08 
 Yeah. Oh, that's what happens when you get to your, like, I guess mid to late 20s is like, you know, you go from like, thinking about going out to like, oh, like, I have a home. Like, what am I going to do with this space?

Dina Bressler: 19:18 
 Like, what if I stack the cans by size?

Sherry Jiang: 19:23 
 Yeah. What would it be like?

Dina Bressler: 19:24 
 Right.

Sherry Jiang: 19:26 
 Cool. Well, I guess when it comes to like, other types of shopping. Right. Like, I mean, you mentioned Amazon mentioned like, thrifting, which is like, kind of in like more like in person, experiential, discovery based. Like, what else do you find yourself, like, I guess buying somewhat regularly. Like, yeah, like clothes, makeup or like, what's. Yeah, what's. What's that kind of look like?

Dina Bressler: 19:49 
 Clothes and makeup for sure. I think makeup. Yeah, makeup. Just whenever I need. Again, I'm adulting. I've. I've moved on. Like, I'm not always a Sephora girl. Now, now I, I start, you know, now I go to like, TJ Max and I'm like hunting through the lip glosses. So I've learned, like, what I want to spend a ton of money on and what I could probably get equivalent at cvs. And then.

Sherry Jiang: 20:16 
 I think.

Dina Bressler: 20:21 
 I want to say, yeah, like clothing and makeup for sure. Trying to think what? Oh, I like Etsy a lot. I'll find, yeah, I'll go on to Etsy. I just like that it's very unique. So I'll go in with, like an idea of what I want and then I find the coolest stuff. So, like, when everybody was ordering their water bottles, like, it's basically, like, $3 difference, and they're so cool. So sometimes I'll go there just to see what kind of stuff they have, and I'll order from there.

Sherry Jiang: 20:50 
 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, like, stuff that, like, you might not be able to really get anywhere else, and it's, like, pretty unique.

Dina Bressler: 20:56 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 20:57 
 Yeah. You say, like, between, like, the. I guess, the times you go thrifting and, like, go on Etsy, like, there's a part of you that, like, likes the, I guess, thrill of the hunt of finding, like, new, cool stuff as, like.

Dina Bressler: 21:09 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 21:10 
 More than just using this stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 21:12 
 Because I also think I want to. Yeah. First of all, like, finding something cool. And then I think also, like, I just don't love looking the same as everyone else, so I like when I find things that are different. I also think, like, being unique is. Is something that it's. It's. I don't know. I guess it's more common because I'm seeing, like, more people buying, like, crazy cool stuff, but it's also less common as people just buy the same stuff over and over. Or, like, like the Lululemon, like, the set that everyone's wearing. I don't like that. I'm like, I want to wear stuff that's, like, me.

Sherry Jiang: 21:43 
 That's you. Yeah. Did you find that there were times where you were, like, buying stuff that were, like, trending and, like, what other people had? And then over time, you're like, I'm going to be more deliberate about, like, I guess, my unique aesthetic. Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 21:56 
 I think high school. I think high school. Yeah. You're like, okay, I'm. Yeah. And then somewhere along college, you realize, like, yeah, no, like, being you is cool. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 22:08 
 Yeah, for sure. And one thing interesting you mentioned as well, like, I guess going back to makeup, before I forget, is you. You said that, like, hey, you don't have to be a Sephora girl. You can, like, figure out what you need and get it somewhere, like, cost effective. Was there a way that you were buying makeup before that was different? Right. Like, were you trying a whole bunch of new stuff versus just spending on, like, I guess, the staples or regular stuff? Like, what was, I guess, pre realization, Dina?

Dina Bressler: 22:37 
 Like, Yeah, I think YouTube was a very influential thing back in, like, 2016 to, like, 2020. And I think, like, a lot of people, they would, like, recommend, like, a palette, like, the Urban Decay palette, and you would run out and buy it. And I think now you have more, like, influencers who sometimes trust them a little bit more. And I also think now you find more dupes, like, for the same thing. So I, for example, like, I love the rare beauty stuff. And then I was able to find the blush I'll splurge on because it lasts forever. But the highlighter, like, I was able to find an elf one that's $6, like, and it's exact same. So I think now you really. You have more. Like, with ChatGPT, you can literally put in, like, this is what I like. What's the equivalent and what color should I get? And it will find it for you.

Sherry Jiang: 23:25 
 Oh, that's. That's super cool. So, like, it's literally helping you, like, search online with, like, shopping links and everything. Or.

Dina Bressler: 23:33 
 You know what I do sometimes with like, like, specifically skincare, I'll put in, like a, like a face cream and I'll say, these are the ingredients. Like that. What? What? Compare, like, this drugstore to this. Like, are there differences in the ingredients? And this is my skin type. So chatgpt is amazing. I'm obsessed with it.

Sherry Jiang: 23:52 
 Yeah, yeah, it's. It's great. It's like, I know, like, you used to have to pay, like, a lot for these, like, color analyses. Like, oh, this is like your, I don't know, skin tone. And, like, these are the things that you wear. And you can just, like, take, like, a photo of, like, your face. And like, GPT can be like, oh, this was, like, for spring and summer or whatever. Like, this, this. These are colors that you can explore for. For that. So it's. It's pretty cool. And it's way cheaper than. Or you're able to actually do it right. Then maybe before.

Dina Bressler: 24:23 
 Yeah, you can ask it for, like, what haircuts you should get. No, it's great.

Sherry Jiang: 24:27 
 Yeah. Awesome. And so we talked about, like, some things that, like, okay, you bought and you're like, okay. Like, I mean, you're talking about, like, the things you bought on Amazon that you're like, okay, I didn't really end up using all that, but I guess, like, thinking about, like, the opposite side, like, things that you spend on that, like, bring you a lot of joy. Like, what are some things that you remember, I guess, recently that you spent money on that you're like, hey, made me really happy.

Dina Bressler: 24:54 
 Or else.

Sherry Jiang: 24:55 
 That was awesome.

Dina Bressler: 24:56 
 Yeah. I bought this bag and it was from Target, and it was an impulse buy because I was sad. And I get so many compliments on it because it's a copy of the Madewell tote.

Sherry Jiang: 25:08 
 Oh, okay.

Dina Bressler: 25:09 
 Yeah. And I don't know if it's gonna last more than a season. Like, it's already kind of like wear and tear. But it was like $30. And I'm so happy I bought that. That was great. Accessories that I spend, like, under 15 on that, like, make a whole outfit. I'm like, okay. That was. That was a good choice.

Sherry Jiang: 25:27 
 Yeah, got it. So the. I guess the. I mean, if you don't mind me asking, like, you said you bought a bag from Target because you were, like, sad. Was there, like. Was it kind of like, I guess, retail therapy in a way or.

Dina Bressler: 25:43 
 Yeah, no, absolutely. I literally. I was like, I'm sad. I'm gonna go to Target. Like, that was. That was the thought process.

Sherry Jiang: 25:51 
 Yeah, yeah, I got it. I mean, was it like. Was it kind of like a once in a while thing or, like, do you. Do you do that, like, you know, I guess somewhat regularly or. It was like, you know what? I was going through something.

Dina Bressler: 26:06 
 Yeah, yeah, I really do that. It was very out of character and I have no regrets.

Sherry Jiang: 26:12 
 You know what? Sometimes you can treat your. It's self care. You can treat yourself like that could have been like, nails or whatever, but sometimes, like, look, if money can solve a problem, like, that's. That's great. And.

Dina Bressler: 26:23 
 Yeah. And I think for me, like, I've learned, like, for, like, my impulse Starbucks orders, I'm never happy with. Oh, shit.

Sherry Jiang: 27:54 
 Sam.

Dina Bressler: 28:30 
 Sorry about that. I just. I. I joined from my phone.

Sherry Jiang: 28:34 
 Oh, yeah, no problem at all. I was. Oh, there's some echo. Oh, okay. Maybe it's gone. Okay. I think it's fine. Yes. I was just checking if it was, like, my network issue, but glad we were able to.

Dina Bressler: 28:53 
 I think it's me. I don't know. It's like the wind outside. My WI fi is. It's like two bars, but I'm on. I'm on my phone now, so it should be fine.

Sherry Jiang: 29:01 
 Yeah, no problem. I think I lost you when you were talking about impulse Starbucks. I, like, you're, like, involved Starbucks buys I'm not usually too happy about, but the impulse, like, that. That makes me happy. That's when I lost you.

Dina Bressler: 29:18 
 Oh, okay. So basically I was saying that my impulse Starbucks thing is usually, like, on my way to work. If I'm like, oh, my goodness, I'm so tired and, like, it's my way to, like, bribe myself to go to work, essentially. And I'm usually not happy. Like, either it makes me late because I have to, like, wait or they don't get my Order. Right. Like, I don't love that. Yeah, that's, like, not my. I've learned to realize, like, when I need retail therapy, like, it has to be, like, intentional.

Sherry Jiang: 29:50 
 Yeah, that. That makes sense. And so I don't know why, like, every time I'm talking, there's a bit of a weird. Okay, I think maybe, yeah, we can switch off, like, muting, because I think that does help. So when you speak, I'll also mute the call. Oh, where was I? Yeah, I guess, like, when. When it comes to, like, I have two questions. Like, when it comes to, like, impulse buys that make you happy with shopping, do you notice that? Do you notice whether, like, the price point makes a difference? Like, oh, it feels like it's like a cool, cheap thrill. It wasn't, like, that expensive, but, like, it gives me a lot of value. That that's kind of the, like, part of it, like, I guess, versus, like, an impulse buy. That would be like, I don't know, like a hundred bucks or more. Right. Like, I'm wondering if the price also has to do partly with it.

Dina Bressler: 30:52 
 Yeah, absolutely. So for me, like, I will not impulse buy if it's over, like, $75. Like, that's. That's. That's too much impulse. I think whenever it's like buying a pair of shoes or even concert tickets, like, I'll put it in my. And I'll, like, sit on it. Just so I'm sure. Because I think, like, even your ads are so targeted and you don't know what's, like, legit. Especially if it's, like, a website you don't know, or even if it is and it's just, like, a sale, I feel like I need to, like, sit with it. So I don't generally just jump and buy something. Like, if I'm buying something impulsively, it's just little. Like, it's TJ Maxx that I'm getting, you know, like. Like chapsticks or trying to think, like, what was the last thing that I just, like, bought? And I was. Oh, I got, like, really cute. It was like these pens that I like that had, like, all different colors, like, really stupid stuff. But it made me happy and it worked.

Sherry Jiang: 31:51 
 Yeah, for sure.

Dina Bressler: 31:52 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 31:53 
 Thanks for sharing all of that. So for the next part of this conversation, I try to see if it's possible to do on the phone. But basically what we're going to do is I have a. I have a chat GPT prompt that I'm going to send you, and basically it just, like, analyzes and extracts summaries for like, I guess your most recent, like, bank statement. Just to like, look at what some of those patterns are and we can like just kind of like talk through them a bit. Do you have something that is available that you can, I guess, put into GPT?

Dina Bressler: 32:28 
 Yeah, I can. I can still use my laptop if you, if you send me the prompt, I could still put it in.

Sherry Jiang: 32:33 
 Oh, perfect. Okay, let me just send it to you on this chat window.

Dina Bressler: 32:38 
 Yeah, This is a lot. Maybe you want to just email it to me because I'm trying to copy paste it and I don't know if it's working so well.

Sherry Jiang: 33:14 
 Yeah, I'll send. Send the prompt in the email, you mean? Okay, let me just. Give me a second. Okay.

Dina Bressler: 33:26 
 Done.

Sherry Jiang: 33:27 
 Yeah, just check your email should be going through.

Dina Bressler: 33:43 
 It. Okay, so just put it into chatgpt and press enter. Yes.

Sherry Jiang: 34:27 
 Okay. Yeah, there's a way to like share screen.

Dina Bressler: 34:34 
 Yeah, I would need to get a bank statement, right? To upload.

Sherry Jiang: 34:53 
 Yes.

Dina Bressler: 34:54 
 Okay, so let me see if I can sign in. All of this is on my phone, but it's very hard to coordinate. So let me see if I can do it. And then. I'm surprised I remember all these passwords. Okay. And it should just be any bank statement.

Sherry Jiang: 35:51 
 Yeah, I think. Is there like we can use the most recent one or if there's like. Because I know holiday period could be like a little like different than normal times. Like if you want to use something from like October that also works up to you. Whichever. Yeah, you think represents like your day to day a little bit more.

Dina Bressler: 36:14 
 Okay, let me see if I have. It's. Okay, so let me just download. I'm just laughing because I'm trying to copy paste it because I think I already used up like my free uploads for the day. So I'm trying to figure out if I can like copy paste the. The message, like the, the contact, like the information, the content. Let me see. I'm sure there's a way because I've done this before. Like I outsmart the chat gpc.

Sherry Jiang: 37:52 
 I think you could also use Gemini for free for a certain amount as well if ChatGPT is being annoying.

Dina Bressler: 38:04 
 Okay, so I have. Let me. Let me see if I could share my screen with you. I'm gonna try again to join this thing while keeping on my phone just in case. Okay, so now I'm here on both. So now I've just logged out of my phone and then here we go. And then you said to share screen, right?

Sherry Jiang: 38:37 
 Yes.

Dina Bressler: 38:42 
 There we go. So funny. I don't usually use like, meats. Okay, so you're seeing my screen, right? Yes, yes, perfect. So this is from August. And I guess I'm realizing now I do a lot of things through credit card and Zell.

Sherry Jiang: 39:13 
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

Dina Bressler: 39:17 
 Deposits.

Sherry Jiang: 39:23 
 Actually, do you have a, like a credit card statement or something that has like. Yeah, yeah.

Dina Bressler: 39:31 
 Sorry. Can you hear me? Wait, I can't hear you.

Sherry Jiang: 39:34 
 Oh, oh, oh, there we go. Can you hear me now? Yeah, I noticed.

Dina Bressler: 39:41 
 I think this.

Sherry Jiang: 39:42 
 Yeah, this, this is probably. Okay, maybe I should clarify. Is there something that actually shows like, more detail around, like, the specific areas that you spend? Because I think this one is more like you'll have like credit card payments and then like Zelle transfers. So like, where you spend, like for shopping, groceries, like eating out.

Dina Bressler: 40:01 
 The thing is, if I spend it on my credit, should I pull up a credit card statement?

Sherry Jiang: 40:05 
 Yeah, yeah, if you have a credit card statement.

Dina Bressler: 40:07 
 Oh, okay, so let me get my credit statement.

Sherry Jiang: 40:12 
 Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 40:13 
 Oh, no, no, that's fine. I'm pulling up my checking account, so I'm realizing I'm like, it's just going. Pulling from my credit card and then it's. Ah, okay, let me go to my credit card. Okay, so statements 20, 20. Okay, let me see if I could copy all this and paste it because this has definitely. This is what you're looking for. I see. And if not, I'll use gemini. Maybe I'll just use Gemini for this. It. I'm like. I'm laughing because. Here, I'll show you. It's like the top thing was from Etsy and I'm like, yep.

Sherry Jiang: 42:24 
 Okay. My gosh. So sorry. I, like, was trying to. I accidentally like, X'd out of the meeting, but I was trying to zoom in. Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 42:34 
 Oh, that's okay. Can you see you're. It's good.

Sherry Jiang: 42:37 
 Oh, yeah, I can. I can see. Does. I guess, like, does the amount you spend at Etsy like, surprise you at all? Or you're like, okay, I kind of expected it.

Dina Bressler: 42:49 
 I mean, it makes sense. I think I was like, pre holiday shopping.

Sherry Jiang: 42:53 
 Okay.

Dina Bressler: 42:54 
 I'm just laughing because I'm like, it tracks. Yeah, yeah, it's like a little higher than the typical month, but it's not crazy. Like, I. I get it. Yeah. And then like the mta, like that makes sense. And then shopping, grocery, like. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 43:17 
 Yeah, gotcha. Feel free to like, I guess, like just scroll through and just like. Yeah, just like say whatever comes to your mind or things that surprise you or things that are. Yeah, yeah. That tracks.

Dina Bressler: 43:31 
 Yeah. So I spent a lot on transportation because I was having car issues because when it got really cold, my car battery, like, froze. So I had, like, problems. So you see, like transport. So I. I spent money on gas, but then I also had to spend money to get around.

Sherry Jiang: 43:49 
 Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 43:49 
 Yeah, the shopping, like, and grocery, like, the things make sense. It actually is, like, pretty decent for what I'm looking at. Like, it was pretty good, I think. Also, I remember in November specifically, I think there was like. Because of how long the month was, I think there was like an extra pay period in it. So I think that was good also, like, more. And then I got Uggs for the season, just so you know. But it was a hundred dollars. It was like a really good price.

Sherry Jiang: 44:18 
 Oh, that's actually pretty good. Yeah. Have you. How have you worn the Uggs yet? Like, do you like them?

Dina Bressler: 44:26 
 Yeah, I like them. I find with Uggs they get really gross after a while. So you do have to buy them, like, repeatedly. So I only buy them if it's like, on sale because otherwise I'll feel really bad.

Sherry Jiang: 44:36 
 Okay. Oh, so you've. You've had them before. Like, this is just like a. Is it like a.

Dina Bressler: 44:43 
 Yeah, it's like. Okay, it's slipper season. Let's go.

Sherry Jiang: 44:47 
 Yeah, makes. Makes sense. You swell up. Yeah. Because normally GPT gives a little bit more detail. Let me just see what I need to have you prompt.

Dina Bressler: 45:08 
 I think towards. Also if this is like November into December, I think towards the end of November because of Thanksgiving, like, I got away with like, going to family and stuff like that kind of. That was helpful too.

Sherry Jiang: 45:24 
 Yeah, got it, Got it.

Dina Bressler: 45:27 
 Actually.

Sherry Jiang: 45:28 
 Yeah. Oh, sorry.

Dina Bressler: 45:29 
 Go on.

Sherry Jiang: 45:29 
 Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 45:30 
 No, no, I was gonna say, like holiday season, it's weird because the pre. Months before are expensive because you have to buy gifts and then afterwards it's like, oh, great. Because, like, you have leftovers and you want a family and like, it's like. So it's easier. But I don't know, it depends.

Sherry Jiang: 45:44 
 It kind of offsets things, I guess, to a. To a certain extent.

Dina Bressler: 45:49 
 Yeah. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 45:51 
 Actually, do you mind asking. Let me see, maybe the total number of transactions.

Dina Bressler: 45:57 
 Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 45:58 
 Can you ask it? Hey, could use. Show me the. All of my transactions, like in chronological order. And then I think it should just give the category and spend anyways. But like, let's see what it says.

Dina Bressler: 46:15 
 Sure.

Sherry Jiang: 46:16 
 Yeah. Okay, cool.

Dina Bressler: 46:25 
 What is this? Oh, maybe. I don't know, maybe that. I don't know what that is.

Sherry Jiang: 46:31 
 Oh, there's another. Thank you.

Dina Bressler: 46:33 
 Mobile.

Sherry Jiang: 46:34 
 Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 46:35 
 Oh, I Think it's when I maybe paid back. I think it's negative. I think that's when I, like, paid because I checked my. Yeah. So I think it's like me just being. Me just paying, paying back my thing.

Sherry Jiang: 46:49 
 Got it. Would you. Would you say, like, this is like, your typical month or. It's, like, kind of different?

Dina Bressler: 47:00 
 The beginning, yeah. But then towards the end, not really because of, like, holidays, but I'm trying to think because we had just had, like, New Year's, Christmas, Thanksgiving. So I'm trying to go back, like, how far back I should go?

Sherry Jiang: 47:12 
 Yeah, yeah, for sure.

Dina Bressler: 47:18 
 I guess, like.

Sherry Jiang: 47:19 
 Yeah. Looking through this, like. Yeah. Anything surprise you? Or, like, oh, this is pretty in line with, like, what I would expect.

Dina Bressler: 47:24 
 I try not to do too much on credit cards, but because, like, a lot of things I can, like, I can Zell a lot. I'm realizing, like, okay, for example, like, nails. I pay cash. Rent doesn't go on my credit card. Right. Like, tuition. Like, there's a lot of things that are not necessarily on my credit card. And I think sometimes that's how I miscalculate how much I spend because I don't necessarily track it so much. And I think.

Sherry Jiang: 47:52 
 Right, right.

Dina Bressler: 47:53 
 That's what I've gotten used to. Like, where are the things that I don't see? But I'm still spending money on it anyway. So, like, when I have friends, like, sometimes, you know, when people want the points, so they spend and then you just end up selling them and, like, it still counts. But, like, in your mind, it's like, no, you didn't spend money on that because it's like, I didn't take anything out of my. My bank because I just zelled it. So I think, like, that it takes. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 48:20 
 So when it comes to, like, I guess, stuff that. Let's take rent out because I think rent's kind of easy to remember that you pay. When it comes to, like, I guess, spending that you have, that's not on the statement, like, what would you say is the biggest. Is it Zell or is it cash?

Dina Bressler: 48:38 
 Probably, Probably Zell, I would say.

Sherry Jiang: 48:42 
 Okay. Do you actually. Yeah. I'm kind of curious because you had.

Dina Bressler: 48:49 
 I think your lot.

Sherry Jiang: 48:50 
 Your. Your last statement on the bank actually had your Zelle payments. I think.

Dina Bressler: 48:56 
 Well, that was my.

Sherry Jiang: 48:58 
 My.

Dina Bressler: 48:58 
 Directly from my account, so I can go. I think this was. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 49:03 
 I'd be curious to know, like, what the Zelle payments were for. For in the same period in time because they might cover more things.

Dina Bressler: 49:11 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 49:11 
 Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 49:12 
 I'm Trying to, like, think. Because that's what I'm saying. It's like, like, this was a.

Sherry Jiang: 49:15 
 This is.

Dina Bressler: 49:16 
 To a friend. This is when I. This is also, like, we ordered in something. This was also, like, for a trip. This is somebody who did my hair. Like, that's so. You know what I'm saying? It's like sometimes those things, they're not on the credit card because people will say, like, oh, I'll charge you a battery. Or it's like a small business, so they'll do Zell. So I'm realizing now that I'm, like, showing you my. My account. Like, a lot of things that I pay for are, like, small businesses.

Sherry Jiang: 49:45 
 Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 49:46 
 Friends. I'm realizing now.

Sherry Jiang: 49:49 
 Yeah. And I guess, like, within, like, the Zell spending. Like, what. Okay. I guess, like, the Zell and like, this statement. If you, like, look across both, like, where do you think were areas that you spent where you consider it? Like, hey, this is like a staple spend that, like, is important to me. It's like a regular kind of, like, repeating expense. And then where do you. So that's category one. So it's like, you know, keep. Keep the lights on. Category two is like, this is the, like, extra spend for fun or nice to have that. Like, I'm cool with. That's. That's great. Like, you know, it's. It's. I'm good with that. That's category two. So, like, extra. But I enjoy it. And then category three, like, things I spent that were extra that I feel like wasn't the best use of money. Right. So there's three of those. Which ones would you say were, like, which ones would you say would belong in each of these?

Dina Bressler: 51:06 
 So it's like, okay, if you want to go, like, necessity. Necessity. Like laundry, rent, car, food so we don't die. Like, those things are like, yeah. Like, necessities to me that are, like, not necessities to other people. Okay. So that for sure, like, nails. I need to have my nails done. I feel like that's important. I didn't dye my hair for a while. Like, I didn't color it. And then I. I just felt really bad. Like, it just was. I was like. I waited, like, eight months, and then I was like, after I had it done, I'm like, this wasn't worth, like, every penny I spent. So for me, like, that's the thing that I'm like, no, I won't feel good unless I do things that are, like, more in between, I think are more like concerts, eating out things that, like, I, you know, like, I, I kind of. They make life better, but if I had to skip, like, I can do them less often if I needed to. And then I think for me, things are like splurges. I love to travel, but, like, it has to make sense. Yeah, it's one of those things where, like, even in the summer, because it's. It's beautiful. Like, I don't need. Need to travel in the summer, but, like, if I can, I would love to. But it's one of those things where, like, it really just depends on, like, what's available and like, what, like, the dates I can have, the flights are affordable, things like that.

Sherry Jiang: 52:28 
 Yeah, got it. Got it. I guess, like, if you were looking back, like, just at like the most recent time period, right. As you're like, reflecting on this, like, do you feel like anything was like a splurge that you didn't think makes sense or you think most things were still, like, category one and two, meaning, like, hey, it was something that, like, I think is a must have, and I'm like, that's great. And hey. Or it's like, yeah, it's a nice to have, but, you know, it's in between. Like, was there anything that. Yeah, basically anything in, like, category three that you felt like was maybe wasn't like, quite worth it?

Dina Bressler: 53:06 
 I feel like always with holiday season, it's when you order stuff for people, it's like, it's very hit or miss. Like, sometimes people don't even appreciate it. And you're like, I did not need to say that. And like, I did that for me. So I think, like, that's something that I've learned over time, but I'm still not the best at. I also think in general, like, you know, sometimes I'll buy something. I don't necessarily think it wasn't worth it. I just don't use it so much. And then it's like, oh, like, I didn't. I probably could have lived without buying that. So I think, like, I'm not. Some people are very techy. They get like, new phones every year. Like, I'm not that type. But I. I will. I will look to see if there's like, cute coats every year. Like, it's. It doesn't make sense, but it does to me. So, yeah, that's my thing.

Sherry Jiang: 53:53 
 Got it. Was there anything recently that you remembered that you like, I guess, bought, but, like, haven't really used, like, as much.

Dina Bressler: 54:03 
 I bought a pair of boots. I was so excited for it. I really haven't worn them and it's been boot season. It just. It doesn't go with so many outfits. And, like, I wore it maybe once, and, you know, you have to break it in, so it just didn't like. It just. I can't walk too far in it, and I'm just like, okay, these. I have them, but, like, I don't know if I'm gonna wear them so much. I just. I have them to have them.

Sherry Jiang: 54:24 
 Yeah. So, like, I guess, like, I mean, of course, like, I think at the moment it's like, you know, it's exciting and, like, maybe they don't exactly regret trying it out, but I guess in retrospect, like, would you skip doing it if you could?

Dina Bressler: 54:37 
 Probably. Probably. Okay. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 54:41 
 But I mean, it's.

Dina Bressler: 54:42 
 It's.

Sherry Jiang: 54:42 
 It's. But it's good that, like, you generally have, like, a positive attitude on most things. Like. Yeah, it's okay. Like, in the moment. I got some joy out of it. Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 54:50 
 Because, you know, the. The worst feeling for me is when you buy something and then it, like, goes on sale. Right. Or, like, you know, you buy, like, certain groceries and then you find out, like, I. Oh, my gosh, I bought these, like, protein bar situations. And, like, then they all got recalled, and I was like, that's ridiculous. Like, I have to throw all these out because they have, like, metal in it. It was like the. It was like one of these, like, interesting companies. That's something also, like, I buy a lot now, so this is what I do. This is like, Pica dsing my brother lives in also. We'll go to Costco together, and he has, like, a family and kids. We'll go to Costco together, and we'll buy things that we like, and then I'll take some from it, and I'll, like, chip in for it. And so that way, like, I get good prices. So, like, if there's, like, certain snacks or drinks or. Yeah, like. Like, if there's a pack of three for, like, body wash, we'll, like, buy it and split it and. Yeah, this is what my life has become. That's my activity. That's fun for me.

Sherry Jiang: 55:54 
 Yeah. I mean, you know, it's. It's like. It's nice to get, like, a good deal and a good deal to, like, try new things.

Dina Bressler: 56:03 
 Yeah, and that's the thing also. I love trying new things. And that's the problem, because sometimes, like, you know, something's good and I'll try something new anyway. I do try to use things up. Like, I won't like, save it, even if it's, like, not great, like, you know, but, yeah, I like trying new things, and that's not always the best. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 56:22 
 When you try new things and let's say it, like, does it quite work out? Like, do you end up returning the items or they, like, don't always get returned?

Dina Bressler: 56:32 
 I'm really not good at returning items. Like, really not good. So usually not. Like, I just give it away to somebody, then return something, because I just. I don't have patience for it. I actually once. And this is why I don't do it, I ordered two sweaters from Zara. I got, like, two different sizes just to see, and I wanted to return the small one. And I dropped it off. I think it was, like, ups. And I dropped it off in USPS and so never even made it. And I had to pay for it anyway. And I was like, you know what? Forget that. I'm never doing this again.

Sherry Jiang: 57:06 
 So you're just like.

Dina Bressler: 57:09 
 Yeah, I'm just like, we're gonna. We're gonna order it, we're gonna gamble. If it's great, we keep. If it's not, we have friends and family. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 57:17 
 Got it. Got it. And when it comes to, like, buying things for other people, like, you mentioned how, like, sometimes, like, it could be, like, I guess a hit or miss. Like, I guess. Do you sometimes find yourself buying things for people that you like and you get the joy out of buying it, and then, like, they're just like, oh.

Dina Bressler: 57:38 
 I thought you were gonna say that. I keep it because I bought for. For my mom and I loved it, and I just kept it.

Sherry Jiang: 57:43 
 Oh, my gosh.

Dina Bressler: 57:44 
 Okay. That's okay. We cover something else.

Sherry Jiang: 57:47 
 Got it. Oh, you're like, oh, I ended up really liking this, and then you just, like, kept it.

Dina Bressler: 57:51 
 Yeah, I was like, this is so me. You know what? This is mine.

Sherry Jiang: 57:54 
 Yeah. Yeah. That's so normal. Yeah. I mean, not gonna lie. I've done that before. Like, bought someone a gift, gave the gift, and then bought the same thing for myself. Because I was like, okay, actually, you know what? I, like, grew emotionally attached to this. I like it. So.

Dina Bressler: 58:08 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 58:09 
 Yeah. So it's like. It's almost like. Yeah, it's like. I guess it is like a, like, small excuse for us to just try new things. It's like, okay, we can get this for somebody. Or, like, oh, like to try something that we haven't done before. Yeah.

Dina Bressler: 58:24 
 I think what you were saying, like, buying somebody something and, like, getting joy from it. I definitely, like, I have A niece that I love getting her stuff and like, like, I took her for her first haircut. Oh, it was so fun for me. Like, I, it was just like a great activity. It's probably one of my. Who knows? Probably. I don't. I think it was two weeks ago, so it wouldn't be on this, but. Yeah, also Zell. But that was so much fun for me. And then we, we went for donuts after, like, we made a whole trip out of it. It was great.

Sherry Jiang: 58:51 
 Yeah. Yeah. No, that's. That's super sweet. How old's your niece?

Dina Bressler: 58:55 
 She is three. So she's at like, cute age where they're still nice to you, you know?

Sherry Jiang: 59:00 
 Oh, yeah. They're like, that's such a good age because they're like, they have a personality because they've like now, now are just like crying, pooping machines. And then they still like. Yeah, they're. They're like, they still like really, like, like old, like parents and older people. And then I think when kids get to like 6, 7, they start to like, you know, I mean, it's okay to develop into themselves, but they are, they just.

Dina Bressler: 59:23 
 They don't like you as much and I don't.

Sherry Jiang: 59:25 
 Yeah, they're not as obsessed with you, you know, but right now it's like, this is your. This is your brothers. Brother's daughter, the one you go to Costco with.

Dina Bressler: 59:33 
 Yeah. Yes, yes.

Sherry Jiang: 59:35 
 Got it, got it. Cool. I know. We just. I just realized we're like 10 minutes over. We also started late. But I just want to thank you for your time and like, sharing all of this. We are trying to build an app that like, just helps like, humanize personal finance more because, like, so many things out there are like, very transaction based, but, like, don't get at the heart of like, why we spend, what are our habits, all of that. So thank you for sharing all of that and like, being so open with me. I appreciate it. Dina.

Dina Bressler: 01:00:09 
 Yeah, no, thank you so much for this. I think it's. This is super cool. I think there's like now, now they're starting to like. I don't know. I get these insta ads that are like, oh, track your subscriptions. And I'm like, I don't even have so many. Like, I strategically share with the right people. Like, we all collectively, like, subscribe to two things and like, I don't need that. It's. And I just find that I do. I spend, I spend a lot, but I actually think I'm like, really fair, but I spend a lot that I don't keep track of. And that's why, like, for me, being honest, like, month to month, it really. It variates so much because if I'm like, do, like, getting my hair done one month, then I'm like, oh, okay, like, let's be really careful that month. And then it. It takes the fun out of doing the fun things because then you're, like, paying for it and, like, suffering the next two weeks versus, like, budgeting it out. So, yeah, I'm not the best with budgeting. I think I'm more of the school of thought where I'm like, Like, I'll just, like, I'll, you know, like. But especially when I did shifts, I used to just, like, work in overtime and then just, like, do catch up. I think that was my mentality, which is so not smart. Like, that's not very. Don't do that.

Sherry Jiang: 01:01:14 
 So I've learned.

Dina Bressler: 01:01:15 
 I've learned how to again, like, temper it. But, yeah, it's something that I'm working on.

Sherry Jiang: 01:01:20 
 Yeah, no, it's all. It's super normal. Because I feel like a lot of times when it comes to budgeting and spending, it's like, it's like before we kn. Like crash dieting and like, like going too intense on New Year's workouts, like, are like, a good idea where you, like, deprive yourself and then you, like, hate yourself and you just, like, rebound and then you hate yourself and you try. It's like. It's actually more about just being consistent and having, like, like a set of values that you stick to and, like, try to be consistent. But discovering that isn't always easy.

Dina Bressler: 01:01:49 
 Right.

Sherry Jiang: 01:01:49 
 Because it's hard to, like, know, like, okay, like, what does make you happy or what things are. Do you spend on that are good function or, like, makes you happy or that, like, specifically is things that you want as a must have. And what are some things where you're like, oh, gosh, darn, if I knew that that was what I was doing, like, I would try to change my habit a little bit if I knew that that was what's happening.

Dina Bressler: 01:02:10 
 Yeah, absolutely. No, this is a great idea. I'm, like, excited to see, like, what comes from it and what you. You guys do. Especially again. Yeah, there's, like, a lot of emotional attachment to spending. And I think, like, there's more. More women in the workplace who are making, like, big money. And so it's interesting because I think that's definitely. You see it in the trends of financials, like, what we're spending is going and what people are spending money on. So it's. I actually just saw, like, the newest generation is, like, spends, like, the least amount of money on alcohol, which I thought was so funny. Yeah. Like, I thought that was great, because I'm like, I get it. Like, I don't. I don't go out for a drink. Like. No, we can match at home, you know?

Sherry Jiang: 01:02:49 
 Exactly. Exactly. Also. Well, I gotta go, but thena, thanks so much for your time, and I hope you have a great rest of your night.

Dina Bressler: 01:02:58 
 Yeah, thanks, Sherry.

Sherry Jiang: 01:02:59 
 Nice meeting you. Nice to meet you, too. All right. Bye.
