Hello? Hi. Can you hear me okay and everything? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:15
Yeah, I can hear you perfectly. Sorry for being a few minutes late. I was out and just got back. 
C
Catherine Yi
00:22
Oh, no, that's. That's fine. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:26
Where are you currently based? 
C
Catherine Yi
00:28
I'm. Well, I'm in New Jersey for the holidays, but usually I'm in New York. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:34
Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:37
So Jersey is like where your family lives and everything? 
C
Catherine Yi
00:39
Yeah, yeah, got it. Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:43
Well, thanks for joining and also being, like, flexible on timing. I know we had to, like, change it a couple of times, but glad were able to find a slot that works. I'll do like a quick intro on myself and what we'll be doing and then we'll just get started. I'm Sherry, doing research on behalf of Peak. We're basically trying to understand how people who just graduate or graduated for like a few years now are making decisions, adulting decisions around things like money. The purpose of this interview is to, like, use some of the learnings here and help shape all of what the product could look like. The first part of it will just be questions for me to get to know you and how you've kind of made decisions around money, your, like, perceptions and things like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:32
Second part we'll be walking through. We'll be walking through like a prompt. Normally we have an app, but I'm actually going to send you a prompt to use to basically mock up what the product experience could be. Do you use. Do you have like a ChatGPT or like Gemini or Claude chat that you use regularly? 
C
Catherine Yi
01:55
I would say I use chat GPT out of all thumb, like the most often. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:01
Okay. Okay, that works perfectly. I will just send you a prompt to use. So it should be pretty straightforward. Any questions before we get started? 
C
Catherine Yi
02:13
So I am not like a recent graduate. I'm still a college student, but okay. It's okay for the. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:21
Yeah, yeah, I think that's fine. 
C
Catherine Yi
02:23
Yeah, yeah, don't worry about it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:25
I guess like, young. Young adults is the more accurate description. 
C
Catherine Yi
02:32
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:33
Yeah. All right. I guess to start out. Any other questions, by the way? 
C
Catherine Yi
02:42
Oh, yeah, no other questions. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:44
Awesome. Okay, well, I guess just to start. Yeah. Tell me a little bit more about yourself. It's like, you know, what you're currently studying. If you're, like, doing stuff outside of, like, school as well, like jobs here and there, what you like to do for fun, all of that. 
C
Catherine Yi
03:05
So I am a college junior at nyu. I am a data science student, so pretty much in, like, computer science, all of that. But I do want to work in Banking and finance. So that's what I'm looking forward to doing right now. I am working as a brand ambassador for a pistachio milk brand. So I feel like it's a very interesting kind of part time job at the moment. I also do a few like little kind of side gigs so that's how I make the majority of my money. I also am really into like drawing and art, so. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:57
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:59
And what made you want to go into, I guess data science. 
C
Catherine Yi
04:06
I liked the first coding class that I took but I thought computer science was kind of like a bit over saturated and I think data science is more new so there could be a lot more opportunities in the future. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:22
Yeah, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:25
Makes sense. And then what made you get started? Like I guess doing some side gigs like brand ambassador roles. 
C
Catherine Yi
04:38
So you know the platform that at least I found this on is Home from college. Right. And so I saw the gig on Home from college to do the brand ambassador stuff and I was like, okay, this is a convenient type of job to have while in school because it's, you're able to like choose your hours a bit better than a normal part time job. Although sometimes I do miss working as like a cashier or in retail because it's very much like you know what you're going to be doing every day and it's always easy. Kind of miss that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:14
Yeah. And what was the motivation to like start doing gigs on home from college? 
C
Catherine Yi
05:24
It was in the summer. So last year, summer 2025, summer, not too long ago now, I was at home of course. And it's a bit hard to find like seasonal work because yeah, they'll want you for a bit longer. But I was like, okay, I'm not going to be in Jersey for the whole year so I need to find something in New York like okay, that seemed like a better option. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:54
Got it, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:56
And when it I guess comes to like since you're, I guess you're still, since you're still in school. Right. When it comes to like I guess like budgeting and spending, like how do you I guess divide like what you spend with like money you earn from your gigs versus like I guess like I, I mean I'm making an assumption, you can correct me if I'm wrong but like maybe some of it comes from your parents for college but how does that usually work? 
C
Catherine Yi
06:29
So I don't get a lot of money from my parents so like supporting myself and everything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:37
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:38
I feel you're supporting yourself in most things right now. 
C
Catherine Yi
06:42
Okay, got It My parents, they told me, like, if you need the help, you can have it. Like if you wanted to, I don't know, go on a trip somewhere and you didn't really want to pay for it yourself, then they could try and do it. But then I'm like, okay, I don't want to have my parents, like, pay for me because I feel like, I don't know, I don't really like taking money from people because I'm like, okay, if I have, if I want to do something, I want to have earned it myself. Right. So that's that. Sorry, what was the question again? 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:20
Oh, I was just. I mean, that was fine. I mean, I think so for that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:27
Then what a. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:32
I guess thinking about like, then how you like, spend and budget, like, could you describe, like, how you like how you kind of manage your money? Like you don't have to have like a strict budget or anything. Like, that's not necessarily the answer, but like, how do you make sure you have enough each month? 
C
Catherine Yi
07:52
So I have a savings and then a checking account, right. And so at the beginning of each month is when I'll move the money from like the savings into the checking account. Yeah, for the month. And I'm like, okay, this is the money that's going to be in your account. You shouldn't have to take any more out. And then that's all I have to spend. So for me, I feel like it's less about dictating. Okay, you have to spend X amount of money on food X on this. It's like, as long as I'm under like a certain amount, then I'm good. So in that sense, I feel it's more like dividing the wants and needs instead of like having a certain amount for everything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:45
And right now, how do you divide between your, like, I guess, wants and needs? 
C
Catherine Yi
08:56
Usually on the weekend I'll do my errands and I'll go get like groceries and that kind of thing. And then throughout the rest of the week, whatever money is left over, I'll spend that how I like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:15
Gotcha. So basically you. You spend the money that you need to spend first and then you kind of give yourself like the option to spend whatever during the week. 
C
Catherine Yi
09:28
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:30
If you look at like your I guess wants category, like, what are, what would you say would be like the main areas for you? 
C
Catherine Yi
09:39
Definitely eating out, buying, like, to go foods, that kind of thing. I feel like I don't spend too much on like clothes or shopping really, but I might make purchases online or do A bit of, like, online shopping once in a while. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:09
Got it, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:10
so would you say, like, the majority is basically just, like, eating out during the week? 
C
Catherine Yi
10:16
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:17
Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:19
And, like, how do you feel about, like, I guess, your process right now? Do you feel like you're generally, like, pretty satisfied you have enough, like, each. I guess each week? 
C
Catherine Yi
10:34
I'd say I am pretty satisfied. So I'm like, I know that I have enough money to get me through the rest of the semester, and until I'm. Until, like, the next paycheck comes in, I'll be fine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:47
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:48
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:52
And if you were to, I guess. 
C
Catherine Yi
10:55
Like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:59
Think about, like, any recent things you've spent money on in the last, like, two months or so, like, was there anything you bought that you felt like you regretted or you didn't feel like you got good value out of it? 
C
Catherine Yi
11:17
I don't want to say, like, I didn't get the value out of it, but, like, holidays was just recently, so I feel like I spent a lot of money on gifts for other people and I kind of indulged myself. And, like, oh, they have the holiday, like, Starbucks drinks, or they have the holiday, like, everything. It's like, oh, my God, this only happens once a year. I have to get it, you know? 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:47
Yeah. 
C
Catherine Yi
11:48
So I think I spent a bit more there just because of, like, the marketing and everything when it's really. Probably didn't have to, but. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:01
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:02
I mean, I guess looking back now, it's been like a month or so. Like, do you feel like you're okay that it happened once in a while that you spent that, or do you feel like, oh, like, looking back, I wouldn't have done it quite that way. 
C
Catherine Yi
12:20
I thought it was a good expense. But looking back, or also looking at my bank account now, I'm like, did you really need all of that? You know? So I feel like I could have toned it down a bit, but I think that's also one of my problems, is that I tend to, like, stop myself from buying a lot of things because I tell myself, like, oh, you don't really need it, even though, like, it would make me happy. But, yeah, so I feel like I will always regret a lot of things that I buy, even if it gives me a lot of, like, value. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:14
You, I guess. Do you. Do you have a. Do you have an example of something that you felt like you bought and you did get value from it, but somehow you're still feeling a bit guilty about it? 
C
Catherine Yi
13:41
I want to say, like, Before I started college, this is a few years ago, I guess, but I bought myself a MacBook and I bought myself a phone. Yeah. And so this was money that I had made from working my part time job and everything. So it was a big amount of money and a large purchase. I mean, it still is, but at the time I really, really wanted to get a MacBook because like in high school I was like, oh my God, everyone has a MacBook. They have all these expensive laptops. But I had like a Windows one and it was kind of older, so I was like, okay, I really want to treat myself and get this, it'll be like kind of a graduation gift, you know. 
C
Catherine Yi
14:32
But then now as I've been using it, I'm like, did you really need to spend this much money on something? Like you could have gotten a different, like a cheaper laptop and it probably would have worked better, especially for like CS stuff because Mac isn't the best for like coding and that kind of thing. And I was also thinking like, I believe the cost of the MacBook was around, I want to say like 1500 around. And then I was like, if I had gotten a, a good laptop for even a thousand dollars then I could have had $500 now to spend on something else. But at the time I really wanted it and I'm, I still think it was a good choice, you know, at the time. So I do regret it. 
C
Catherine Yi
15:30
Well, I don't want to say I regret it, but if I had the choice, I probably wouldn't get a MacBook. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:41
Got it, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:45
I guess it's always like hard to know some of those things. What about like, I guess recently you mentioned there's some things you indulged yourself with during the holidays. You mentioned like Starbucks. Was there something, what, were there other things as well? 
C
Catherine Yi
16:13
I'm trying to think that. I know during the holiday season it was also like final season in university, right? And so I told myself like, okay, you're gonna be studying all week, you don't have time to cook food, you don't have time to do a lot and you're gonna be stressed. So it's the time where if you were to buy like food out, the cost is like negligible, you know, like, oh, you're studying all day, you have to get something to get you through it. So I was like, that's how in my head I, I forget the word, but it's like that's how I told myself that it's okay, you can make all these purchases. You Know, like, justification. Yeah, yeah. To justify it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:12
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:14
And, like, looking back, like, how does that make you feel. 
C
Catherine Yi
17:20
Looking back? I'm thinking, Catherine, you're a bit silly because it's like, why would you. Again, I'm also a big coffee drinker, so, yeah, coffee is. At least in the city, it's a big. A bigger expense because the coffees are so expensive. And it's like, I have a coffee machine at home, but, like, during finals week, say, I would usually drink, like, two coffees a day. And sometimes it gets to be a bit much where I'm like, oh, I don't want to go back home and make coffee. It's so much more convenient to buy out around school, even though I know, like, it would probably even taste better at home, that kind of thing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:20
Got it. So, like, I guess if you were to, like, do it over again, you would try to. You would want to balance it out a bit more than just, I guess, go on autopilot and then justify it as, like, okay, I was studying. 
C
Catherine Yi
18:41
Yeah. I probably would try to make a plan and use it more of, like, a reward instead of. Yeah. Like a daily thing. Like, I could say maybe, like, as long as you finish all of this, you can get a coffee instead of, like, oh, I need this in order to get through, like, a certain subject or something. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:11
Yeah, yeah, that makes. That makes sense. And I mean, sometimes, like, indulgences are okay. Like, are there times where you let yourself feel okay about. About it, even looking back? Because nobody's perfect. Right. 
C
Catherine Yi
19:31
Yeah. I feel like this is a. It's just a very constant struggle for me where I'm, like, trying not to feel bad. But now I think as I make more of these purchases, I'm telling myself, like, it's fine, you know, because nothing. It's not the end of the world when I spend money. And I'll always end up making it back somehow. So especially when I get paid or if someone were to give me money as, like, a gift or something, if I spend that money, I'm like, okay, it's fine because you didn't have it before anyways. Does that make sense? 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:29
Yeah, I. I kind of do. It's like, you think of that kind of money slightly differently than, like, your own. You're like, oh, it's a gift, so it's fine. It's free money. 
C
Catherine Yi
20:39
Yeah, yeah. Like, it's a bonus, I guess, like. Yeah, yeah. Would it, like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:53
Would it help you if you felt like there was a little bit more peace of mind where you can distinguish between like the spending that you give yourself permission to spend on. I don't feel bad. And then also know the ones that you should feel bad about and be more accountable because sometimes that distinction is tough. 
C
Catherine Yi
21:13
Right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:14
And that can create a bit of anxiety. 
C
Catherine Yi
21:17
Right. I feel like say if I were to make a budget or had something that really allocated like my money. So I guess I usually base like what I can spend or not on the amount that I give myself each month to spend. But if I were to allocate that into like real categories of like, oh, you can spend up to this amount on food instead of just trying to keep it as little as possible, which I tried to. If I were to actually say to myself like, oh, you can actually spend this amount up front. So then wouldn't seem like a kind of. So I guess it would be easier to spend because I already know that money is going to be gone by the end of the month. Does that make sense? 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:39
Yeah. Basically if you've mentally prepared yourself to like spend somewhere and you made the conscious decision, you potentially would feel less bad because I guess it's like similar. 
C
Catherine Yi
22:54
To. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:58
It'S like there's some companies that have like endless vacation policies and some companies that have like, oh, you have like 15 or 20 a year when you have endless vacation policies. People just don't take vacation because they feel guilty. But if you're like, oh, I have like 15, I have to take all of them because you're like, oh, I gave myself permission. I guess if you in this case like don't have one specific to different categories, it's possible to feel like you're just trying to spend as little as possible. Even if maybe you are okay to spend something in some area, but maybe that creates a bit of that feeling of guilt. 
C
Catherine Yi
23:41
Yeah. Because I think I also feel like at this time because my income is still not like a lot because I don't have a full time job yet, I'm still like scared that if I spend a lot of money then it'll be gone and I'll be in some like helpless position or something. But even though like I'm already going to be spending money, so it's fine. If I had like something to tell me, okay, you have this much left and normally like at this point in the month you would have spent X amount of money, then I would have a better baseline as to like what is still capable to be spent, you know? 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:40
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:42
So like if you knew like let's say the last month that, okay, I spent the same amount last month. By this point in time as I am now, you might feel like, okay, that's. That's normal. That's okay. Like, it's not like spending money shouldn't make you necessarily feel bad by default, as long as it's, like, reasonable. 
C
Catherine Yi
25:01
And then I feel like that vacation date analogy was actually pretty close because, you know, at the end of the year, when people have a lot of, like, extra days left, they're like, okay, I'm gonna take it all just so it doesn't expire or something. I feel like at the end of the month or so, if I see I still have money left, I would still be able to spend that anyway after seeing it instead of actually saving it. So then it's like living frugally for no reason. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:36
Yeah. Or like, sometimes if you hit your goal or whatever you were supposed to spend, like, you can treat yourself. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:43
That's okay. 
C
Catherine Yi
25:44
Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:47
But I know it's not easy because, like, it's. Yeah. I mean, it's. It's hard when, like, there's always worry around, oh, what happens in the future, or things like that. 
C
Catherine Yi
26:00
Yeah. I feel like right now, when I still don't know, like, if I'll have a job after school or these kinds of things bring some anxiety. Even though I feel like realistically, or at least the hope is that I will be secure, it's just like, that still feels kind of far away to me, you know? Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:29
You're probably trying to, like, protect yourself from a future where you're uncertain. I guess, in a way. What have you spent money on recently that you did feel good about or enjoyed and didn't spin in your head about it? 
C
Catherine Yi
26:57
Like, recently, I bought some new running shoes, and running is a new hobby that I kind of picked up over the past year. And so I was really excited to get a new pair of shoes that I know I would. Like I know would fit me and that I know I'd get a lot of use out of because I feel like instead of just spending it on, like, something that would be gone really quick, it's kind of enabling me to do something that I enjoy and that would also make me happier, make me healthier. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:40
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:41
Are you comparing this against, like, spending that you don't feel like lasts beyond the moment? Because you said, hey, I buy this and I can keep enjoying it. What is that in contrast to? 
C
Catherine Yi
27:54
Well, I said that I usually end up buying a lot of food out, and so I don't normally have that much time to, like, go out to physical stores and go clothes shopping or that kind of thing. So my purchases, I feel, are most out of, like, convenience for me. So I don't spend that much time, like, doing research or looking online for things. But with the shoes, I was really searching, like, oh, what are the best shoes for this and everything. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:41
Yeah. I mean, it seems like it was a very, like, deliberate decision. And if it's something that, like, you value in your life, which is, like, a hobby and then also, like, in turn, like, fitness, I guess if, like, you were to. Hypothetically speaking, let's say your shoes cost 80 bucks. I'm just making that up. If you were to look at, like, 80 bucks shoes and then 80 bucks of, like, food, would you be like, wow, like, I'm glad I spent it on the shoes instead of the food? 
C
Catherine Yi
29:14
I think so. Because a lot of the times when I do buy food, I'm like, oh, my God, Catherine, if the night before you had packed yourself a lunch, you wouldn't have had to buy food out. So I'm like, I feel like every time I buy food out, it's like, did you really have to do that? You could have waited, like, a few hours and then had food at home and that kind of thing. Yeah, but then with the shoes, it's like, okay, well, if I didn't buy a pair of new shoes, I could, I don't know, get injured, have my feet, that kind of thing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:57
Yeah. Like, when you go out and buy food, would you say normally it is, like. It's more so for, like, survival and, like, the need to eat or like, is it also, like, I just really like this one thing that I'm buying to eat? 
C
Catherine Yi
30:15
Probably both. Because on the one hand, I'm like, oh, there would be no way that I could make this food at home. I'm gonna have to buy out because I'm craving it. But most of the times that I do buy food, I'm at school, and I don't have, like, a meal plan or anything. So I'm like, if I don't bring food from home, then I'll have to find food out somewhere. So I think it's mostly out of, like, survival. But sometimes I. I do also try to, like, I. I want to say sometimes I deliberately don't bring food from home, so I could try new places outside. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:12
Got it, Got it. 
C
Catherine Yi
31:19
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:19
I have one last question before moving on to the next step, but I guess now that you're, like, articulating like, oh. Like, sometimes I tell myself I wish I just prepared and packed a lunch. Like, what's stopping you from doing it today? 
C
Catherine Yi
31:40
Probably not planning my time correctly, because a lot of times I'll get home kind of late, and I'm like, all I want to do is go to bed. I don't want to be out prepping a lot. So I guess when I do make food at home, it's always kind of, like, pretty simple to make, and then it ends up being like, the same thing a lot of times because I don't want to have to learn something new. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:15
Yeah. 
C
Catherine Yi
32:17
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:19
Gotcha. 
C
Catherine Yi
32:20
Gotcha. Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:25
That's the end of the first part. For the second part of things, I. 
C
Catherine Yi
32:32
Want to. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:35
Ask you if you're comfortable doing an exercise where you get your, I think, latest bank statement so the transactions. And then I have a prompt that. 
C
Catherine Yi
32:49
I will send you to run in. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:51
ChatGPT to basically, like, organize the data a little better. And we'll just do, like, a similar exercise as what we're doing now, but, like, with some recent spends in front of you. 
C
Catherine Yi
33:06
I don't have my bank statement online, but I could find the, like, the printed version. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:18
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:19
Do you have that available in front of you? 
C
Catherine Yi
33:23
I. It might take a while to find it, but I could also try, like, uploading screenshots of a few previous transactions. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:36
I think screenshot is probably okay. 
C
Catherine Yi
33:40
Okay. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:44
Here, I'll send you the prompt. It's just in the. It's in the chat. 
C
Catherine Yi
34:00
Okay. Okay, let me try to export this. Look from the last month. So, yeah, say like, December. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:46
Yeah, December is good. 
C
Catherine Yi
35:09
It. Okay, it's analyzing the document. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:02
Do you mind sharing your screen? 
C
Catherine Yi
36:06
Yeah, let me see how to do that. Oh, good. It should be up. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:35
Yeah. Feel free to just, I guess, read through it and, yeah, just, like, share your reaction as you're going through things that surprise you, things that, like, you kind of knew. 
C
Catherine Yi
36:51
Okay, so it says the top one is TJ Maxx. And this is when I was going Christmas shopping. So I'm like, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:05
Those are gifts. Or did you buy some of that for yourself? 
C
Catherine Yi
37:10
I believe they're all gifts. And then it says the most frequent is mta. And this is because it's the subway. Most of the time I try not to use the subway because it's getting more and more expensive. And so I'll use, like, the school shuttle bus or try to walk everywhere. I'm like, okay, that makes sense. For shopping. Again, it's like the same TJ Maxx. There's TikTok shop. Okay. And then CVS and a pharmacy. So when I went to CVS, I was trying to look for Christmas, like candy and that kind of thing. So that's what that was for. For food delivery I did. I ordered from Too good to Go. And that's like. It's kind of like discounted food. Like, if the restaurant has any food left over for the day, then it's. Then they'll put it up like that. I guess. 
C
Catherine Yi
38:45
I did go to a few coffee shops. It sounds pretty correct. And then there's more food from Chipotle Bagel Store. And then the food lovers is from Food Truck, I believe. And so this is what I'll normally get when I'm on campus because that's what's nearby. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:17
Gotcha. So these are like regular spots that you would go to? 
C
Catherine Yi
39:21
Yeah, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:25
And by the way, is this for the entire month or this is just for like maybe two weeks? For one week. 
C
Catherine Yi
39:32
I think it's for most of the month. But I was at school until December. I want to say, like middle of December. So after I came home then I stopped spending a lot because I could. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:53
Be home. 
C
Catherine Yi
39:55
Yeah. Yeah. So that's probably why it's a bit lower because I think I do tend to spend a bit more than this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:02
Okay. So like, normally it might be like maybe like double ish. What you would see here for like coffee and food. 
C
Catherine Yi
40:13
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:13
If you're on campus the entire time. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:17
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:20
Like when, now when you're looking at like the coffee and the food amount, like, how does it make you feel? 
C
Catherine Yi
40:30
When I see the total of this, I'm like, see, $85. I'm like, Catherine, you could have bought yourself like another pair of running shoes or something for that amount. So I'm like, if you are taking a new pair of shoes as like a splurge, but you're spending a lot of money on food, then all this food can kind of. It's like, I don't know, because I'm telling myself, like, okay, this is eight transactions, so that's eight meals for 85. I'm like, okay, you know, $10 per meal is pretty reasonable in the city, but if you are at home, like in New Jersey, and you spent $85 on eight food transactions, I would feel kind of bad. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:37
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:40
So I guess it's like a complicated feeling because the individual doesn't feel like necessarily a lot because it's like, okay, it's like 10 each. But then when you put it all together, it Makes you realize, oh, it could get you closer to, like, another pair of shoes, which, you know, like, would bring you a lot of joy. 
C
Catherine Yi
42:01
Yeah. Because I'm like, if this is only for like, half a month, let's say, then the full month is more. And I feel like if I put this money into groceries instead, then I can make better food and have, like, more variety in what I eat, say, than just spending it at the same places. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:38
And if you knew that, like, taking the extra step of groceries and making food at home got you closer to, like, getting a new pair of shoes, would that motivate you to do that more? 
C
Catherine Yi
42:55
Hearing this, like, especially at the beginning of the year, where in my head I'm like, okay, New Year's resolution, new habits, new me. I'm like, yeah, I would totally think that I could keep that mindset up. But in practice, I think spending on food would still happen. Unless it was like, every single time I thought of, like, oh, I want to go out and get food, I could immediately tell myself, like, think of what you could buy instead. But I know in the moment I'm always like, if I want food, technically there's nothing actually stopping me from getting it, you know? 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:45
Yeah, Go on. Yeah. 
C
Catherine Yi
43:54
Like, if I did end up buying, say, like, I went to Chipotle, if I had something telling me right after, like, catherine, those new shoes just went up $10, then I would be like, oh, can I return this burrito bowl, please? But I don't know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:18
Yeah, so basically, like, I mean, it's always hard to tell, like, what you would do, but it sounds like at least it'll make you think a little bit more. Actually, I'll explore it this way. Right. Like, let's think about other times you've, like, created new habits. You mentioned you got into running. Right. How recent was that? 
C
Catherine Yi
44:50
I think around March or April, so. So a good few months ago. But I want to say more recently is when I've tried to be more consistent with everything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:07
Gotcha. 
C
Catherine Yi
45:09
And. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:09
And how did you build that habit to be more consistent? Because it's like, it is hard, like, to, you know, get. Get up and do it. 
C
Catherine Yi
45:23
I want to say a big part is on social media and I guess, like, what I consume a lot because I got onto, like, the running side of tick tock. And so, yeah, even on, like, my off days, and I'm like, I don't want to get up and do anything. I'll see people out there, like, running and having so much fun. So then it makes me Want to have that kind of experience. And so even when I'll be like laying in bed at night and there's like no way of getting out at that moment, I can be excited for like tomorrow and going out for a run. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:10
Got it, Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:15
I guess if there was something similar where it was like, because there is TikTok actually around, like mindful spending, not like don't spend at all, but more like, hey, like being intentional about it, could it possibly create a similar effect for you? 
C
Catherine Yi
46:32
I definitely think so. Like, when I was in high school, for example, I really wanted to get into like stock trading and that kind of finance field. And so on YouTube there are a lot of like, people talking about finance and oh, I made X amount of money. This is how I did it. So I think that is very interesting to me. A bit less so I want to say when people are kind of trying to tell you like, Exactly how to. How you should like spend your own money. Because then I'm like, oh, no one really knows my financial situation. So this kind of advice is a bit like, I probably wouldn't take it to heart as much as something more exciting per se, like stock trading or. 
C
Catherine Yi
47:47
Because I feel like when you think of finance and stocks and say that kind of thing, it can be very much marketed as like adrenaline, like high stakes. But then personal finance, it's a lot like easygoing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:11
Yeah, that makes sense. There's like less adrenaline, I guess, involved in it. 
C
Catherine Yi
48:16
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:20
Now, out of curiosity, you did have one place you or one transaction at TikTok shop. Do you remember what that was? 
C
Catherine Yi
48:32
I also want to say that it's a gift because I don't tend to buy on TikTok shop normally, but I did get my sister a gift from TikTok shop and I think it's because it's. Some of the stuff on there is very unique. So I guess when you see it, you're like, oh, I don't know if I can get this somewhere else. So it would better to buy on there. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:10
Gotcha. Makes sense. But like, usually you wouldn't really spend, I guess on yourself there. 
C
Catherine Yi
49:18
Yeah. Unless I saw something very appealing and very like something very unique, then I wouldn't buy it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:35
Gosh. Have you ever bought anything from TikTok shop for yourself? 
C
Catherine Yi
49:40
I have and I've also done some of the review. Like they have more gigs at home from college where it's a product company and they're like, oh, buy our product and review it and that kind of thing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:57
Oh, gotcha. What? So was it mostly like, I guess for work? 
C
Catherine Yi
50:04
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:05
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:08
And did you like the items that you did buy, like, outside of like, needing to review them? 
C
Catherine Yi
50:15
Yeah. I mean, I think I've TikTok shop very much as like temu or taobao, so I'm not really having high expectations for quality. But it's more like a fun kind of thing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:31
Gotcha. When you mean by like fun, is it what. What part of the, like, what part of it is the fun element for you? 
C
Catherine Yi
50:41
Like, not very much the necessity, but it's fun to scroll through all the items and wait for something to arrive in the mail? I guess so, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:54
So it's like the more like the process of getting a new thing and anticipating it arriving than like necessarily needing the item. 
C
Catherine Yi
51:03
Yeah, yeah. Like, you know, the fun household gadgets and stuff where it's like, okay, I don't need this, but it probably wouldn't make my life more convenient, but it would be cool to have it kind of thing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:19
Yeah, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:23
And would you have anything that you bought on TikTok shop that wasn't for reviews? It was just like you scroll and you saw and it looked kind of cool? 
C
Catherine Yi
51:32
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:34
Do you remember what some of those items were? 
C
Catherine Yi
51:39
I got a pair of slippers and it wasn't like a normal household slipper. I'm pretty sure it was a dupe of something. Yeah, that wasn't so. But I thought they looked cool. So I was like, okay, I'll get it because it's cheap and it looks cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:08
Gotcha. Did you end up wearing it? 
C
Catherine Yi
52:12
Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:14
Okay, Cool. Is there anything else on this, like, list of spends that like, you that aren't covered in like your normal habit or you feel like this is actually a pretty good indication of like, what it would look like? 
C
Catherine Yi
52:40
I think normally there would be more coffee in there. Otherwise I do think it is pretty normal. Like, I try not to do that much shopping. Like, I don't normally have that much time to like, peruse in stores, so I feel like it's pretty normal. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:17
I guess the area that you worry more about spending are the convenience ones where, like, it doesn't take that much time to spend it. Yeah, for shopping you have to spend more time. 
C
Catherine Yi
53:31
And I feel like because the convenience ones, like the coffee and the food, like, at the moment it doesn't seem like that much money. I'm able to do it a bit more freely because I'm like, okay, it's only like $5. That's not really much. But Then seeing it like this, I'm like, it can add up to be a lot. Yeah. Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:03
Well, that's actually it in terms of my questions. Thank you so much for your time, Catherine, and being flexible, the time as well. 
C
Catherine Yi
54:15
Yeah, no problem. I know in the notes when it was being rescheduled, it was like, oh, it's about the holidays. I'm like, okay, I understand. It can get pretty chaotic at times. Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:31
But glad we finally got to find a time. 
C
Catherine Yi
54:35
Yeah. Is there anything else you need from me or. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:41
I think. I think I'm good. 
C
Catherine Yi
54:45
Do you have any more questions? I wanted to ask a bit about the compensation for this, if that's not too upfront. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:59
No, not at all. 
C
Catherine Yi
55:01
Because I know there wasn't, like, a actual posting for the study. I guess so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:10
Yeah. 
C
Catherine Yi
55:12
Did you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:13
Let me just try to remember, was this the two. One conversation or two conversation? One. 
C
Catherine Yi
55:22
I think this is one conversation. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:27
Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:29
So I think the one conversation one is 75. And a gift card. The two conversation ones, 150. I mean, it's the same thing, but there's two conversations. How we'll do is I'll basically go back. So Yash is the one who's handling the schedule and everything. I basically go back to him and tell us we chatted, we finish chatting, and then I think a gift card. 
C
Catherine Yi
55:55
Is sent over once we conclude. Okay. Yeah, it's less about, like, the amount or something, but more about, like the whole process of. Because I. No, I got a message to me talking about this, but I'm not sure exactly. Like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:19
It's okay. 
C
Catherine Yi
56:20
Don't be shy. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:20
You can totally ask these questions. 
C
Catherine Yi
56:22
Yeah, no, it's okay. I was just a bit confused about, like, everything that's going on. Like, I know it said we had to share our spending, but I think that's what the prompt was. Yes. Right. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:40
Yeah, yeah, that's what it was. We've been change, like. Like a week or two ago. We've been doing it within an app, but the app has been changing, so it was actually easier to just do it with a prompt because it's just English. Yeah. So, yeah, so. 
C
Catherine Yi
56:59
So you're. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:59
You're good. Thanks for confirming. I'll also let Yash know if there's any confusion in the way it's being written. But yeah, it's. It's totally fine to ask. 
C
Catherine Yi
57:11
Okay. Yeah. Thank you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:14
Yeah. Thanks for your time. 
C
Catherine Yi
57:16
Yeah. Thank you for having me. Yeah, of course. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:20
All right. You take care. 
C
Catherine Yi
57:22
Yes. All right, bye. Bye.
