Let me see if. 
Let me see if I can turn on my camera. Are you based in New York or are you based somewhere else? It. Sorry, I'm gonna have to join the camera on my phone, so just trying to get that up there. Can you hear me? 
Oh, sorry. I think I'm gonna take off my AirPods. I couldn't hear you. Oh, sorry. If you were saying something like I couldn't. Yeah, wasn't able. 
Yeah, no worries. I was just saying that I'm trying to get this camera on my phone, so just bear with me with that. 
Yeah, all good. 
Are you based in New York or are you based somewhere else? 
Yeah, I'm based mostly in San Francisco, California. 
Oh, okay. Nice, nice. Do you guys have any winter storms going on over there or. 
No, not. Not as much. It just gets cold, but. 
Oh, okay. 
Yeah, you get it in Tahoe, though, if you go up north, but. Okay. Okay. 
From Texas. And we just got our first, like, quotation marks, like, winter storm, which. Any, like, person from the east coast says that, like, they'll just be laughing at Texans people because, like, they're just. 
Like. 
Yeah, like east coast all the time gets, you know, like a cold front. And they're like, it's more of a thing versus here. 
No, for sure. They're just like, yeah, we get all the time. Like, what is this? Panic? 
No, like, Texas people panic so bad. Like, I went to the store and it was genuinely empty. I'm like, guys, please. Like, it's not the end of the world. 
People are just like, stockpiling, I guess. Yes, yes. 
I'm like. I kind of get it, though. Like, we're just not. We're just not really equipped, like, infrastructure wise for the cold, but. Sorry, I'm having trouble getting this camera here. 
No, all good. Where in Texas are you from? 
I'm from Dallas, Texas. I used to live in Houston, but I just moved to Dallas literally like three, four weeks ago. But one thing I noticed is that the cold, it like, gets more cold here in Dallas than it ever did in Houston. Like, my family's all in Houston and they're like 40 degrees and I'm like, 20s, so. 
Oh, my gosh. 
Yeah, okay. Definitely. Definitely a difference in terms of weather, I guess, but. 
Yeah. Got it, got it. Do you like it after, I guess, moving there? 
I mean, so far, yes. I haven't gotten a chance to explore too much, but, like, it's. It's still Texas at the end of the day. And I mean, I went. I lived in D.C. before. Like, I Went to college there. But I'm also from Texas, like in Houston. And I don't know, I, I do like Texas culture, so I do appreciate a lot of the things that we have here. 
Yeah, for sure. 
Is there any, like, other type of. Is this the only way to join this meeting? 
I can, I can try on zoom. I haven't used it in a while. 
Okay, sorry, I don't mean to inconvenience you, but if you could try that. Just because my camera always works, it's just, I don't know why Google Meet is not working. 
Not cooperating. Yeah, let me see if I can. I have to say I haven't used zoom in a while, so let me just try. 
Okay, yeah, no worries. 
I haven't started a zoom. 
Let me just. Yeah, I just assume you probably need the. If you don't need it for this, the research or study, then no issue with me. But if you do, then. 
Oh, I don't think we need it necessarily. Just the. There's a part of the study at the second half where you have to show your screen, but I think you can do that even with the camera off because that's a separate thing. Sure, yeah, I think it's probably fine. And just like. Yeah, as long as I can hear you, I think that's important. 
Okay, got it then no issue with me then. 
Okay, cool. All right, we'll get started. So I'll quickly introduce myself and then would love to then turn it over to you. So I'm Sherry and I'm doing research for Peak. We're learning a bit more about how people who just graduate from college for a couple of years are making decisions around money and other kind of early adult kind of things. And we're doing this because we have a, we're a startup and we have a product we're looking to refine based on the feedback. So the interview will be in two parts. So the first one will be just me getting to know your background, how you've kind of made these decisions. 
And then the second part, I'll be running through an exercise with you where we're going to, you know, use I think one or two months of like real spending data from your side and we'll run through actually a, like a GPT prompt. Oh my God. Sorry, my cat just knocked something over. Hey, sorry, Give me one second. 
Yeah, no worries. 
Still a little bit of water. Okay, I think we're good. Yes. So yeah, second part of the interview will be more like a hands on exercise that we'll go through together. 
Okay. 
Any questions before we get started? 
No. 
Okay, sounds good. Yeah. So tell me, I guess, more about yourself. We already started getting into the swing of things. Maybe what you studied in school. You mentioned you were at DC what you're doing now. 
Yeah, I guess, like. 
Yeah. How old are you? What do you like to do for fun? Like all that stuff? 
Yeah, for sure. So I'm originally from Houston, Texas, like I mentioned, but I went to college in D.C. and I study finance and marketing while I was a student there and kind of just went the finance slash real estate route. And that's what I do now. I work in real estate. I am 23 years old. What else? I. For fun, what I like to do. I mean, I like to hang out with friends, go grab food. I also like to play golf on the side a little bit. I like to exercise, whether that be through, like, going to the gym or through, like, doing Pilates. And I would say those are the main things that I do. Yeah. 
Awesome. And I guess. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna. 
No, all good. Oh, my gosh. 
He's a little bit of a kitten. So he's been a little. 
He's so cute. Hello. 
He just. Sorry. I'm sorry. Like, a few things that I'm trying to make sure. He's very uncoordinated right now. So he's like, I have another cat. And he's, like, more graceful. And I'm like, oh, cats know how to, like, walk around without knocking things over. 
But not. How old is he? 
He's seven months. 
So we just saw him. Yeah. 
Yeah, he's a baby. So he's a little. Anyways, back to this. Yeah. So tell me more, like, I guess, like, what. What got you into, like, studying, like, finance and, like, I guess pursuing this particular career? 
Well, it's funny because I initially went to college thinking I was going to study international relations. And then after my first year, I just did a 180 as much many college students do, and decided I wanted to go into the business school. And my main reasoning there was. I mean, I was always interested in personal finance. Like, just me, myself, and I, like, I. It was something that I was conscious about and that I liked just keeping track of. And so I thought to myself, well, if I study finance, then I'll learn how big organizations, bigger companies really think about their own finances and how to structure a business in a way that, you know, like, it's profitable and then it functions correctly. And so I thought that Acquiring a lot of these skills would be helpful for my own personal life, honestly. 
Got it. Got it. That's super interesting. And you mentioned, like, this came from, like, a personal interest in, I guess, your own finances. Like, how. 
How. 
I guess, how's that going? And, like, what do you, like, what do you currently do for that as well? 
Yeah, I mean, since I was in college, I have a. I made a budget for myself that I still to this day, pretty much use. And I. I mean, this is way more detailed than a lot of people probably use, but I update it pretty much every, like, other week. Every other week. It's just a budget I made when, like, my last year of college or so. I include, like, everything. Just all my. All my necessary expenses, like rent, utilities, phone bills, insurance. I also include any, like, expenses for the month, like groceries, any shopping I do, and I track it. I would say, like, pretty much almost every single dollar, honestly. 
Yeah. Gotcha. And did you find this template or find a template online, or did you just start creating this yourself based on, like, what you were, I guess, learning? 
Yeah, I mean, I think I came across. I think I started it as, like, a budget template that I saw probably a video online, and then I just, like, tweaked it a little bit more for myself. But at least the way I like to keep my budget, like, I really just want to know what I'm spending my money on and what it's going to. And as long as it serves that purpose for me, I think that's what's most important. And it does just that. Could it be improved 100%, but I haven't bothered to do that. 
Yeah, got it. And when, I guess when you, like, started tracking your budget or I guess, budget and spending, like, what were some of the areas that you were like, whoa, I didn't know I was spending this much. I'm gonna go and, like, you know, maybe adjust some habits here. 
Yeah. One thing, I guess sort of unexpected is like, this. And this is almost like a catch all. But the miscellaneous. It's really important, I think, to have a miscellaneous budget, because a lot of things come up in a month that you really wouldn't expect, like a parking ticket for whatever reason. And another thing is, like, I go in, like I said, I go through my credit card statement. I check every single transaction. And one thing that I also noticed was that sometimes I would be like, what is this transaction? Like, I don't remember doing, like, spending this. And so I would realize sometimes that I had subscriptions for things I didn't use or that like, maybe I forgot to cancel or something. Right. 
And if I didn't, if I wasn't checking that as much as I check it, then I would be spending like, I don't know, $50 or more per month in things I genuinely don't use. And you just have random subscriptions. But I would say I'm pretty good at keeping track of those simply because I, I check my, my expenses pretty often. 
Got it, got it. What would you say are like, areas where like, you are proud of, like, being really on top of when it comes to like, spending and budgeting? 
I think, like, because I know what I'm working with, like, I know my sort of allowance for myself, like, I'm pretty good at keeping within my means. I guess you could. My budget means just in terms of like, I don't go into the store thinking, let me buy whatever I want. No, I already, like, thought about, you know, exactly. Basically roughly how much I'm allowed to spend. And I probably already thought of the things I'm gonna buy just because of that. That's more so like specific to grocery stores, by the way, but. 
Okay. 
Yeah, gotcha. 
So for like staples, like groceries, you're like, it's not really a huge surprise because, like, I, I have put some thought into what I need to get. I'm gonna walk into the score, get these things, stick with my budget, and then, like, leave. 
Yeah. And like, I am, I'm also like I said, like, I've been doing this for a while and it's not like I over, like, it's just me at the end of the day, like, that I'm getting grocery for. Right. Like, if it's not like I need to eat steak every single week, it's not like, you know, have all these kind of things. And because I'm just in the habit of not needing them, then it's not really an issue. 
Right, right. Makes sense. Makes sense. Is there anything that like, you felt like after transitioning from like, college to like working in Dallas that was like, particularly more challenging to budget for? Or again, you're like, hey, I had a process before, I adapted it. Just some things that were different in terms of living expenses, and that's fine. 
Fine. 
Yeah. 
I mean, there's always is just because, I mean, when you're in college sometimes to some extent, this is obviously person to person, but you're still somewhat relying on your parents. Like, they sometimes might still cover like your phone bill. They sometimes might still cover your insurance. Like, like, smaller stuff like that. Right. And when you go live on your own, you kind of, like, at least for me, I basically took over all my expenses after I graduated, so there's way more expenses that are necessary. So now my money, like, goes into a lot more things that. That. It's not like, I could just be like, no, I don't want to pay my, like, car insurance this month, or, no, I don't want to pay my, like, utilities as well. It's like, oh, no, I don't want to pay my, like, wi fi. 
Or I don't want to pay the water bill or, like, the electricity bill. Actually, this is a huge one. Electricity. When you're living at home, when you're, you know, you're just like, you don't think about it as much. And then when I started living on my own, like, I'm like, no, I'm not using. I don't need the AC on all the time.  like, without overdoing things. Right. But, like, I am definitely way more conscious of, like, how much usage I do of, you know, just, like, my utilities and stuff. 
Got it. 
Got it. 
And if you think about, let's say, like, the last. I know the last few months, like, recent things you spent on what are some of the things that you felt like you was really worth it. That brought you a lot of joy. 
I think it's always, for me, worth it. Like, is making sure and setting, like, a budget aside or money aside for, like, your own hobbies, like, things to do just. I think it creates a nice balance. And this is gonna sound silly, but I. I really enjoy my, like, grocery, like, every. Every week. I'm like, oh, I know this is how much money I have to play with. Like, let's see what I can do with this for this week. That's so random. But, like, I actually enjoy it. 
Like, enjoy the process of, like, seeing what you can fit within the budget. 
Yeah. Like, it's like, it's not a crazy budget, I like to think, but, like, it's just like, I obviously have to think about my meals before this because, like, I'm preparing lunch, I'm preparing, like, my dinner. I'm like, you know, stuff like that. So I don't know. Yeah. 
What are some things that, like, you recently bought at the groceries where you're like. Like that. But, like, I'm happy that fit in my budget, and I, like, thought that was a great purchase. 
Well, a few different things, honestly. Like, basics, like beans and, like, rice is just like, it's. It sounds so silly, but, like, rice literally goes with like, a ton of different meals, right? And it's very filling. And then beans as well. Like, I just prepare them once a week, and there's so many different ways I can eat, like, fry them so they taste different. And I can also eat them whole so I can mix and match, you know, the flavor and the way I eat them with different meals. And, like, it's just. I like things like that. But. Yeah, I don't know if that answers your question, but. 
No, no, that's. That's a. That's a good answer. No worries. And then you also mentioned, like, spending for hobbies, right? This is for, like, what would you consider, like, within your hobbies? That's like the, I guess, like, the sporty kind of stuff you do, like golf, Pilates, or do you have, like, other things that you consider as, like, I guess, like, hobby spending? 
Well, no, because unfortunately, Pilates memberships are very expensive, right? So I. That's what I account for as, like, a hobby. So, like, for example, like, my, like, Pilates membership, like, that's what would count. But if I wasn't doing that, which since I just moved to a new city, I still haven't, like, picked a place. So that budget is still, like, flexible to random things. So that could go for, like, my outings to golf. Because every time. And like, practices, practice for golf. Because every time you go practice, you need to, like, lease the, like, the golf balls and stuff like that. So it just fits in that category for me. 
Got it, got it. Make. Makes sense. And anything that you spent money on recently that you felt like you kind of regretted or you didn't think was worth it. 
I'm trying to think. Yeah. I bought like, these things from Amazon for my apartment where I'm like, I probably didn't need this right now. Like, I. It was like these, like, organizers for, like, soap. Like detergent soap. Like, soap already comes in. In. In something, right? Like, you don't need organizers. But I like to organize things. So I was, yeah, I need them at the time. And then I got them. And I'm like, why did I buy this again? 
Yeah, yeah. So basically you were like, I had a, like, intention to organize. I bought it when I was just, like, browsing online, I guess. 
Yeah. 
And then you're like, wait, this is already kind of organized. 
I don't really need it, right? No, like, it's like, I'm sure it'll look nice once I put it in there, like, in. In these, like, containers or whatever. But it's just, like, an unnecessary purchase. Right? And. And not unnecessary in terms of, like, I don't need it right now, and it's not like it's bringing me a much greater sense of pleasure by putting detergents in these containers. You know, happiness isn't going to increase by doing it. 
Yeah, that makes sense. Would you say, like, generally speaking, when you spend on things that, like, you're, like, not super happy or worth it comes from things like this where, like, you had an idea of what you were going to use something for, and then, like, when they actually came, you're like, oh, like, I was a little off about it. 
Like, what? What do you mean? 
Yeah, like, I was just wondering, like, if, like, when you think about, like, other times where you, like, felt like you're. You were spending on things that weren't as meaningful. Like, were they similar kind of cases where, like, you had something in mind, you bought it and then didn't end up using it? Like, this is obviously like, more like, I guess, a product example, but could also be like, I don't know, you bought, like, a piece of clothing you thought you would wear on some occasions more often, but then, like, you didn't, and then it's, like, sitting there. So that's just like. That's the question. 
Yeah. Yes and no. But it just. Just in terms of, like, I obviously tried to be very careful about bigger purchases and things that I buy. So when I do buy clothes, I tried for it to be, like, something that can be used in multiple occasions. And, like, a lot of thought goes into it. But obviously in the past, like, in the past when I would buy things way more often, it is a shame because then it just ends up sitting in. Either in your closet or it just doesn't get used as much. But as long as something or like, the item that I purchased brings some sort of benefit, like, actual benefit to me, where I'm like, okay, I either use this often or I see it often, and it makes me happy seeing it, then it's fine. 
Like, then it's a fine, like, purchase. But. But if it's something where I'm not really gonna see it, like, benefit, or it's gonna bring, like, a lot of, like, happiness or value, then that's a purchase that I would not be too happy about. 
Yeah, Got it. So it's like, I guess it's a combination of, like, you use it and then when you use it, you're Happy about it, basically. And yeah, if it's not, then I guess like that would be what the soap organized or the organizers purchase felt like. 
Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah. But like the way I also think about that is like, for example, I'm gonna put them in the containers, right? Yeah. And then like, see in my head when I was looking at these videos of like people organizing their like laundry rooms, it just looks really nice and like super aesthetic. I was like, oh my God, I want exactly that. Like, it's gonna look really good and then I get it. And it's not that I'm not like, I'm sure it'll look nice, it's just like it's not really gonna, like, it's. I guess it's not gonna make me as happy looking at it as I thought it would. Does that make sense? Like, I thought it was gonna bring me such much like much more pleasure seeing this organized very aesthetically. 
And then I'm like, actually, I don't think I care that much. 
Oh, got it. So did you see the videos on like Instagram or on like on. 
Tick tock. 
Tick tock. Okay, got it. So it was almost like maybe it was like the esthetic of it. Like you're like, okay. Like people are like, it looks nice. And like it's something that I, I thought I could see myself kind of like enjoying and yeah. Getting into that feeling of like organizing feels good. And then when you, when you actually got it, you're like, okay, it's not, it's nice, but not quite what I imagined or felt when I saw the video. Yeah, yeah, got it, got it. No, that makes sense. And that's totally normal as well. Yeah. And if you're comfortable, like, I would love to hear a bit more about like how you do your budget as well. 
And I don't know if you have like a version of it without like full numbers, but I'm just curious because some people budget like based on like categories. But it sounds like you budget on like themes as well. Like. 
Oh. 
Because hobbies could also like cross many different areas. Right. Because hobbies are like, could be sports, it could be like sewing, or it could be like friends. Like, how do you think about what's meaningful Categories, like, to you? 
Yeah, Let me see. I, I just have to open it in Excel. Let me see if I can like just quickly show you. But I just like I told you I'll keep it pretty simple. Just like my actual like bills My. Let me go to more recent, because I guess it changed a little bit. 
Oh, good. 
Yeah. I also like to budget for, like, things in advance. For example, like, when Christmas was coming up, I actually started budgeting for that, like, I think months in advance. Like, probably four or five months in advance. And taking money out of my paycheck every single, like, I said amount. And so when Christmas came, then it's not really, like, a huge shocker. 
Yeah, that's actually already better than most people, because I think holiday shopping could really shock people how much they spend, because they're like, oh, I bought things for people. But then not everybody has a plan. So they go in and they're just like, wow, I just spent, like, 600 bucks. Or, you know, I mean, and that's fine, but it's more just, like, how much you spent like, that you were, like, surprised and. 
Yeah, and the thing is, people, like, don't track it, and so they. They probably don't even know how much they spend, which is the actual scary part. I. I mean, that's not to say that I think this year I actually went over my budget that I had set by, like, I think 100 bucks or so. But, like. Like, it's not a huge deal. 
Like, it's at the end of the world. 
Not like I'm like. I'm also not like, okay, this. It has to be this number. It's just like, I just want to prepare as much as possible. 
Yeah. I mean, it's. It's better than, like, oh, I was, like, 500 bucks off. Yeah. Or like, I don't know why I was 500 bucks off. And, like, where did those things go? It's like. I mean, 100 is. 
Yeah. Okay, let me see if I can share my screen here. I have a ton of tabs open. Let's see if this works. So this is basically what it looks like. So I have, like, my rent, my phone, my water bill, electricity, WI fi. My rent is broken down into, like, these two things. So I also add that I don't have a car payment, but I have that in there. Insurance. Yeah. This is actually not supposed to be here, but. And then I have, like, how much income comes in from work, other streams, whatever. I have my variables. Shopping. Shopping. I use. Dining, I use. Gas, I use. I don't use this anymore. I used to use this when I lived at home. 
I actually made a fund for when I would move out, so that came in handy when I did move out, but I don't use that anymore. Groceries I get fun, I use that. I put money aside each month so when people's birthday celebrations, etcetera, Comes up. Miscellaneous, I don't use this anymore. Travel, I use that. Hobbies, I use that. So I try to put money each month for these things and this. 
Okay, got it. Oh, interesting. So I guess for hobbies, it's like a. It's like a fund where you kind of take whatever is left and you put some money towards it, and then you just give yourself, like, the freedom to spend it. As long as you have money there. 
Yeah, like, I have that there, so I can use it in whatever shape or form. And then this month, because I just moved to a new city and I still don't have, like, a set club membership that I want to join. So this month, that money I actually use towards, like, honestly, just, like, hanging out with people and making friends because I'm in the new city. So that almost counted, like, my hobby. 
Got it, Got it. Is your hobby spend, like, kind of like, what miscellaneous, like, used to because you said, oh, you don't use it anymore. They both seem like they're like, almost like flexible spending categories. Like, it depends on the season, right, that you're in. 
Yeah, it does depend on the season. Like, typically, like, right now, hobbies. This month was. And the thing is, my job also covers, like, gym memberships and stuff, but not everything. So whatever I end up spending out of my own pocket would come out of that specific line item in hobbies. And so that's technically what this is supposed to be used for this month. Just because I still haven't figured out, like, what I'm going to do in this new city. That was basically same thing as miscellaneous. But what I allocated mostly towards hobbies was, like, if I was grabbing drinks and meeting this, like, girl or something, if I was, like, almost also, like, extra dining and money. Honestly, like, going out, you could think of it, but, yeah, it was interchangeable with miscellaneous this month. 
Okay, gotcha. 
Makes sense. 
Yeah, I mean, this is, like, pretty straightforward. It's like you've got, like, the things that you, like, have to cover, which is like, I need this live. And then, like, the middle is like, these can move depending on, like, what the month is. But I give myself the freedom to have, like, a flexible budget that usually is, like, kind of more on the fun side. Like, maybe certain months, like, you go out more because you have friends visiting and, like, you go out or, like, you know, once you, like, figure out a club that you want to go to for like working out. Like that will be where that budget comes out of if like some of that isn't like covered I guess from work. Yeah. 
Yeah. And I'm always like adding like random. Like one time I got my car tow. This actually happened a long time ago. I got my car show and that was like 300, which I. This is obviously not. No longer there. But I. One time I got my car towed so I had to add that specific line item. 
Yeah, there's. Yeah, I totally feel you. I. I used to have this line item in my budget. I just call it like the. I used to call it like Sherry is dumb fund. But it's basically like things that I was like, you know what, I will make mistakes. I'll get like a speeding ticket, like you know, get like a late fee and I'm like it's fine. Like this is what I set aside to like you know, deal with mistakes. Because that happens. 
Yeah. 
And it's like it's okay. Like life happens. 
But yeah, no, that's also like that's basically kind of my miscellaneous. Honestly. Because. Yeah, no, because sometimes like and things do come up every single month. Like I used to be like, no, like it just doesn't make sense why people would spend more than. Than they think. But things do happen. Like either you're car, like something can happen to your car or I don't know like a ticket or anything like that. So yeah, for sure. 
Like, yeah. And this. It's good to know that like you know it can happen and you have some like some way to account for it. Awesome. So for this part of the interview we have like about 22 minutes. I have a prompt that I'm going to send you to run on ChatGPT. If you use that model, you can also use another one as well. But I assume most people have chatgpt that they're using. 
Yeah, perfect. 
And if you have I guess one month of a recent statement, I mean. 
I think you probably anywhere where you. 
Have I guess like some month of spending. Basically what this prompt is going to do, I'm going to send it to you. It just, it was like organize your spending into like different categories so it's like a little bit easier to like see some of that. Yeah. 
Okay, let me quickly read through this first. Okay, so basically you just want this algorithm to take the information from the backend statement to see where everything is going. Like all like every single transaction. Yes. Okay, let me see if I can get this here. Just going to send this to Myself so I can put it in chatgpt. All good. Just logging into ChatGPT. I think it asked me to log in to upload it out, like any document or statement. Yep. Take your time. Okay. 
Once that's up, do you mind sharing your screen? 
Yes. Let me see. Okay. Then I just put the. Yeah, hopefully. Let me see if that one works. I actually don't think I had spend that much on this statement. So. 
See, was this for, I guess, the holiday period or. 
It was January. It ended January 17th, I believe. Okay. 
Oh, so it's January 17th. So was it half a month or was it a full month? 
That's a good question. It might have just been. Well, no, I think. No, sorry. It was 12. 18 to 1 10. 
Okay. I think that's like close enough to a full month. 
Yeah. Okay. I love how this, like. 
Yeah, she's consistent. 
I know. Honestly, that's the thing with ChatGPT. Just getting too smart nowadays. It starts speaking to you like they're your friend. 
Yeah. 
Okay. It's. 
It's a little. Do you remember what some of these were for? Shopping. Were. Were these the organizers? That was something different. 
Yeah. So Amazon, like I said, I moved in. I had more expenses this month because I moved into my apartment. So Amazon makes sense. Dillard's. I had to get a new pair of shoes for work. Black shoes specifically. So that's where I think that. Unless that was. Yeah, I think. 
Also was for, like. Was it like existing makeup or like, new makeup that you were buying? 
Well, I'm thinking since this was between holidays, it could also be something for somebody else, but that's a good question. I actually don't. Look, I'm trying to remember. 
Yeah, actually, one thing you can do. 
No, this wasn't. Sorry. I know what it is. It was a wax machine. 
Oh, okay. Gotcha. Was this a gift or this is for yourself? 
No, this was for myself. 
Okay, gotcha. Was it something that you bought that was new or like you had a. Like you were replacing something? 
No. Well, I used to have one at home and, like, I just needed one here and I like. It's just, you know, if I buy one, then I don't have to go into the actual, like, store where you're obviously going to spend way more money in a year. So that's my reasoning. 
Makes sense. 
Now even some of these are throwing me off because now I'm like, what did I spend $54 in Apple? I'm sure I could figure that out, but I don't think that was A transaction I made consciously. Apple. I don't know. I'm gonna look into what this was now. Now that I look at. Yeah, I don't think anything crazy. I don't know if this is a full month, but I guess it should because I. This is definitely not full month. Coffee is the one thing I actually love spending money on for sure. 
Like, for you. Like, is it like the experience of you, like, go out to get coffee with people or is it like a energy boost in the morning or. 
Well, I. Most of the time I make my coffee at home, but like on the weekends I do like to go and get coffee. Like just either with someone or by myself. Doesn't really matter. I'll go regardless. 
Got it. So it's like a treat for yourself? 
Yeah, it's like a treat. 
Exactly. I'm good to spend that. I'm making it at home most of the time. So it's like special. 
Yeah, exactly. This is also coffee, actually. This. Okay. 
It just got categorized as dining, I guess. 
Yeah, I don't. Yeah, this is gas. Yeah, this is. This statement was weird. I don't think there was much useful stuff here, but. Yeah, my Nespresso for coffee. 
The. The Apple spends sometimes. I don't know if you have any, like, subscriptions you're paying for, but those tend to all pop up as apple dot com. Kind of. Give an example. I think I was using a Mac. A fitness tracker called Macro factor and it appears as an apple.com charge, not from Macro Factor. 
Yeah, Actually, yeah, you're right. I think what it is, now that I think about it, I think it's my hatch. I have the. The hatch alarm. Oh, yeah. And this happened around December where every. I think it's around December they, like redo your subscription. That's what those $54 are now that I think about it. Yeah. But yeah, that was at least this one. I don't think this one was that helpful. But yeah, let me know what else you need or any questions you have. 
Yeah, I mean, for shopping, like, was that mostly just like, I guess, moving in shopping? 
Yeah. Just thinks that I need it, honestly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, nothing here is like, that's gas. That's groceries. Groceries. This was like. I take it back. This was actually these curlers because I'm trying to curl, like, do my hair last, like with. With heat. So this was just like heatless curls, the wax one. The what? Sorry? 
Oh, sorry. Ulta was the heatless curls. 
Yeah. 
Oh, okay. 
Yeah, I forgot because the wax was actually from Sally. So that's not even on this statement, but. 
Gotcha. 
This is Heatless Curls. This is groceries. That's just my coffee from Nespresso. This is just bunch of like moving and stuff, you know, random stuff in there. Dillards. This is actually not shoes. This was a face wash that I ran out of and so I needed one. And then this was my hatch re subscription for the year. 
Got it, got it. Was it easier to remember like what these were for once you saw the dates tied to them? 
No, honestly, not really. That's why whenever I do my. My tracker like underneath it where I'm like actually putting every single category, I usually put exactly what it is. Like I would put like sometimes, like not all the time but like I'll put like Dillard shoes or something. 
Right, right. 
Just because like I been to dealers twice and so I thought it was the shoes, but the shoes weren't 41. Shoes were like 100. This was my face wash and I just remember as well. 
Yeah, got it. 
And then same with Ulta. Like I thought it was the wax, but there's just no way wax would be $20. That was more like 60. This was my the like rollers for the hair basically. Yeah. 
Okay, got it. 
Heatless Curls. 
Okay, gotcha. Makes sense. Do you have like a another month that you have that like represents like maybe like a different. 
Yeah, let me. I've been using this other car more maybe. Let me see if I can get a. Let me see if I have a statement from this card. View recent spending. So this one's what December 29th to. Well actually let me. Okay. December. So I guess this is the complete statement because I used two carts. So this expenses in combination with this other statement is more accurate picture of this statement. Like mid December to May. January. 
Got it. 
Let me get that first. Let me first send this to myself and then I'll share my screen again. Sounds good. Okay, I think. And let me know if this makes sense. I'm going to combine all those three statements that are roughly for the same period and re. Put them in ChatGPT and that's the same thing. 
Yep, that works. 
We can skip the ones that we already discussed. It. Okay, never mind. Only lets me put two statements. So I'm only going to put the ones that are relevant to this other transaction. This is so funny. Walmart. Yeah, I mean like I had a lot more expenses in terms of like moving in to places. So this one this month, I think December to January Was a lot more hectic than my normal spending. 
But so the Walmart spend was also like, moving, right? Not. 
Yeah, like plates, like getting plates. Getting like shampoo, stuff like that. So it's like all of this was necessarily groceries. It was like combined. 
Okay, got it. That makes a lot of sense. 
Yeah, yeah. That's why this. This was like a. 
You're loyal but not monogamous. 
Getting a little too comfortable. Yeah. 
Oh my gosh. It's saying, yes, queen. We know. 
I. 
Okay, the Dillers. That's the shoes. 
Yeah, that was the shoes. 
Got it. And then Creighton Barrel. I think it's also probably like furniture and like. 
Yep, that was furniture. Yeah. I think this sec. Because this. It like broke down the purchase. 
Oh, hello? Are you still there? 
Yes, perfect. 
Sorry, I thought. I was just making sure we're not frozen. 
Yeah, same thing here. Walmart was a lot of. Trader Joe's. That was. No, this was. This was flowers. Whole Foods was groceries. Walmart is a combination of things. That was dinner with my family, that was brunch, And this was lunch with my friend. They even me. Yeah, this is just gas. Yeah, coffee. That's coffee. I don't know what. I spend $27 at 711 that month, but no. Yeah, That was my Netflix. And. Oh, yeah, I needed a new. I needed a new eye exam. 
Oh, okay. Got it. 
Yeah. This was the wax. This was my nails. This was coffee, actually. 
Oh, okay. 
I don't know why this is called HSC Healthcare, but I do. Yeah, this was moving in stuff. Task rabbit. Yeah, I mean a lot of these. Moving in, moving in. Yeah. Cool. 
I guess, like, I mean, you already do your budgeting, so you're pro. Probably on top of this. Was there anything that you looked at that like, surprised you a little bit or like you felt a reaction to. 
Well, this month actually. I didn't track it for my own purpose, for my own well being. I didn't like fully track it because. Well, I. I tracked it and not. I had like a separate bank account where I do. Where I have my like money for like furniture and stuff. So it wasn't coming out of my paycheck. It was more so coming out of that account. And some of these things, it depends. These are just like how I. I structure them. Like my. I examine. I needed to do that because I needed new contacts. And obviously I cannot go to work without contacts, so. But that I just put that part of moving in. 
Okay, gotcha. 
Supposed to be there. Probably not but I just put it there because I was like, that is a huge sum. 
Right, Right. 
But, yeah, no, I knew. I knew this. I mean, that month I spent a lot in just moving in and, like. Yeah. 
So. 
I don't think there's. Yeah. No. Nothing unexpected here. 
All right. 
Cool. 
No, thanks so much for your time, Vanessa. We're just, like, a couple minutes over, so I appreciate your time, but thank you so much for today and. Yeah, thanks for sharing everything. 
Yeah, for sure. I mean, appreciate your time and. Yeah. Well, thank you so much, and I hope you have a great rest of your day. 
For sure. All right, you take care. 
Bye. Bye. Bye.
