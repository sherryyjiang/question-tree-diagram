Hi. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:05
Good to see you again. How have your last couple of weeks been? 
M
MxL
00:10
Pretty good. How have yours been? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:13
It's been good. Spend some time with family. But now in did a trip to Thailand, so I was there for some music and now Singapore. So just a bit of travel and settle down now for Christmas. 
M
MxL
00:27
Sounds fun. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:30

Cool. Well, I guess to give you a little bit of a description of what we'll do today, really appreciate the time you spent with us last time. Learned a lot. And appreciate your honesty, vulnerability and sharing all of this because it really means a lot to us as we're trying to build this product. Hey, how things are going to work is we're going to spend the majority of the time actually walking through a new app we built by app. It's more like a prototype or it's like a, you know, a rough sketch but you can still use it and we're getting feedback from you around the product. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:06
So similar drill as what we've done last time, where I'm just going to shut up for most of the time, or tried my best to shut up for most of the time and just like, see you kind of use it in its most natural state. So don't worry about like, oh, what you think I want you to be doing. Just like, do what you want to do. And if there's any point where you're like, okay, I want to go somewhere else in the app, that's fine. Make it about like how you kind of like process proceed in the app and also continue to just share whatever comes to mind out loud. I always say this like microphone to the head kind of principle, but just like stream of consciousness. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:48
It doesn't have to be fully formed thoughts, but those are usually, I think the most interesting reactions is when you first see something like, oh, okay, I don't know what quite of this, but like, that's interesting. Yeah, that's pretty much the gist of it. Any questions before I send over the link to the app for you to play around with? 
M
MxL
02:09
No, everything's clear. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:11

Okay, awesome. Let me send you the link so it's. I'll paste it in the chat book Peak Money. Don't click on the Fireflies or the Fathom. Those are not takers. But just see the link that says book Peak Money. Then just like last time, if you can share your screen, that's. That'll be great. And then instead of linking a bank account, this will be a PDF upload of a recent like bank statement. If you have one readily available. 
M
MxL
02:52
I'd have to pull that up. I don't have any available right now. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:57
Okay, no worries. You can. You can take your time to do it. That's okay. Yeah. So let you get you set up on that. 
M
MxL
03:08
Do I just sign in as regular to the link because it says sign in to continue to peak or like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:15
Okay, just sign in. 
M
MxL
03:17
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:18
Okay. 
M
MxL
03:34
Did I use my icloud to sign in? Because it Sundays my Apple ID is not allowed to sign in. Hold on. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:42
Oh, try your Gmail if that's causing an issue. 
M
MxL
04:11
I don't think it's the same account with the Gmail. That's the thing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:16
Do you mind sharing your screen and I can probably help guide you. 
M
MxL
04:20
Yeah. Screen. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:30
Okay. 
M
MxL
04:31
Is everything visible? 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:34
Yes, it's just pixelated, but I think. 
M
MxL
04:37
It'S adjusting right now. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:42
Yeah. Okay. I think this is correct. So just click upload. It says receipts, but it's really just a statement. 
M
MxL
04:50
Okay. I would have to send it from my phone because I don't have anything in my laptop right now. So if you could just give me a second. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:59
Yeah, Take your time. No problem. 
M
MxL
06:03
If it's saved. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:24
So this will take a minute or two. And what you're first going to see is a series of just like explainer screens around what the app is supposed to do. You can read them or you can like click through them until you. 
M
MxL
06:40
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:40
Oh, it's already there. So there's nothing you. You have to do on these first few screens because they're just explainers. And then you'll get to the app. 
M
MxL
06:52
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:55
And I'm just going to have you, like, play around with it for now before I jump in with stuff it. By the way, did you upload a bake statement or you uploaded a receipt? 
M
MxL
08:03
Okay, got. Seems like it's roughly showing about the same thing for like, different, like dates and stuff. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:47
Yeah, I'm. I'm kind of wondering because that's actually not supposed to happen. So let me. Here, let me just screenshot this because I think we need to fix something. Give me one second. Okay. Okay. I'm going to pivot and try to do. Do it this way because I think there's something funky going on. But we're going to do it this way. Why don't you try to start over on the flow? So go back and we're going to use mock data instead. Yeah. Try to see if you can. 
M
MxL
09:46
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:46
Maybe go to settings. Yeah. See if I can try to go to the gear icon. Let's see what we can do here. Reset data. Yeah, Just say Reset data? Yeah, just click Use sample data at the bottom. Ideally, the best is if this is your own data so you can recognize things, but I think we'll have to fix something. So. So this is someone else. This is, like, fake data for now, but I think it can still give you a general sense of or flavor of things. Okay. All right, now go ahead and play around with things. Just tell me what's going on in your head, too, as you're, like, looking through it. 
M
MxL
11:12
I kind of like these, like, little caption things that Peak has going on. I feel like the app is kind of trying to be more personable to you, and it's kind of like a communication thing or like something you can use to reflect on. So I really like that. Can't really say much about the icons, but I don't know what these are just yet. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:38
So what do you mean by the icons, these things? Oh, okay. So basically the responses for you are not. You're not sure how you would answer, but you like the idea of being able to reflect. 
M
MxL
11:51
Yeah, I would have to spend time with more, like, what I purchased, since, you know, this is not my data. And I was actually kind of getting confused when I was looking at my data because my next bill is a lot less than what we just saw. So that was a bit confused. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:09
Yeah, it was. 
M
MxL
12:10
Like, $32 is nothing compared to what I'm seeing on my screen, which is like 800. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:15
Yeah, no worries. 
M
MxL
12:18
Okay. Though I am pretty curious about this part. How would the app be able to tell, like, your people or, like, stuff you do with others, considering, like, you're just putting in, like, your statement or whatever. I mean, unless It's Venmo or PayPal where you can see, like, money being given to someone or being sent to you where, like, you can see their name or, like, they're like, a friend or whatever. But kind of wondering how this bit would work. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:00
Maybe I'll turn the question on you and ask, like, what would be meaningful for you? Like, what would. Would you want to see something here? Because I'm assuming maybe. Yes, because you asked the question. 
M
MxL
13:15
I personally don't think it's really fit for me. Okay. Since I'm not someone who just goes back and forth with, like, stuff like that. I do, like, more of my inputting money myself, sending money myself, and those are mostly for bills. So this bit wouldn't exactly work for me. And then anything I do with people is more with cash. So it's not really going to reflect on, like, the statements and stuff. So that bit wouldn't be useful for me. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:45
I could tell you how it works, but totally understand what you're saying. So this is for helping you remember where you had like social related spend with people. So let's say you go out to eat a lot with some friends or you know, you share some bills with roommates. I mean, those are just cases. What we would do is if you go up, back up to the top, to the. The very top of the app, if you close this right, we would maybe ask a question like, hey, I saw that you went to Chipotle, or I saw you went to, I don't know, Chili's. Who did you go with and what was the occasion for? Then you would reflect and say, oh, I went for my. I haven't seen my friend in a while, or I went to see my friends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:39
And then we would then ask you, okay, who's the person? And then you can see, okay, like, you know, Molina and Sarah, like went to Chili's. That's how it would work. Now obviously for different people, like, there's different levels of usefulness for that. So it's just a way to provide a little bit more meaning behind some spends. For lower. It's relevant. 
M
MxL
15:06
So ultimately it's kind of like a financial diary logging kind of thing, right? 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:11
Yes, correct. 
M
MxL
15:14
All right, that's clear. Is this part kind of like what we initially talked about in our last meeting? The thing I showed you on my phone when I said I really liked it? Because I noticed, at least when I was checking the app on my phone today, there's been quite a bit of changes on like the app layout. Seems like some stuff have been taken out. So I'm wondering if the stuff being taken out is kind of being replaced with this. Because I recall like the preferences, the aura, whatever thing I said last time was useful to me. So I don't know if this is like the replacement for that, but I do kind of like this bit, the preferences part. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:08
Yeah, yeah. Tell me more about. Actually, let me show you where you can see. So close this one. 
M
MxL
16:17
And then. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:17
Sorry, go back. 
M
MxL
16:19
Just. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:19
Yeah, I think if you go to December 15 to 21, there should be more stuff you can see on like mock preferences. We scroll down or not. Okay, let me try to. Maybe I can show you on my version sometimes like we. We make some of these changes and. 
M
MxL
16:42
I could probably do like this like kind of like a stamp thing. I think it kind of adds to the app in terms of like the aesthetic and everything. So I do like this, like, you being able to add photos and it gives more of like a cozy app vibe, at least to me. So I do like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:58
Yeah, gotcha. And actually going back to preferences, what would you. What would be meaningful for you to see there that you would like in general or. Yeah, for yourself? Yeah. Like, if Peak were to like, basically get to know you and understand you as like you're kind of journaling and reflecting on these transactions, what would be some things that you'd be like? Oh, that. That'd be interesting to know. 
M
MxL
17:35
Okay. The first thing I would really like to know is my patterns. I found it really useful when I was able to see like, oh, I. The absence. Oh, you go to shopping at Macy's on Thursdays, Thursday evenings or whatever. So I kind of want to know like shopping patterns and stuff and like where the money is going. So that is something that was really useful for me. I would want to have something like a financial challenge, if you will, where like in the next five days, try to spend, I don't know, Instead of like 400 on your shopping experience, try to spend 200. And if you do this, you're gonna get points or whatever. 
M
MxL
18:16
And going back to what I said in the first meeting, the point system thing would be really fun, at least for me and I'm assuming for other people too, at least in the app. So that is quite major for me in terms of engagement because I kind of like a reward process regarding that. So. Yeah, and I think it would also allow like the app developers and like everyone programming to see like, and more streamlined streak of like everyone going on the app every single day because there's something that's kind of like rewarding them for going on the app. So there's that. I believe we still have the chat feature. Yes. Since the last. Okay, if it's in there, then yeah, I really like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:07
Yeah. Why don't you try to find the chat feature? Because we're also trying to see how people can like discover it as well. So see if you can find it. There you go. 
M
MxL
19:27
Approximately how long do these conversations go back and forth for? Because since I haven't really experimented with the chat feature, I don't know how long it's willing to talk. Is it like kind of set up like chat GBT where like the conversation flows, or does it stop at some point after learning, oh, like your favorite breakfast spot is, I don't know, Danny. And you just buy like, I don't. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:49
Know, is it something like that? 
M
MxL
19:52
Good Question. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:53
So the way that it's set up in this particular app is actually a little bit more structured. So it's never going to tell you to shut up, by the way, but it will basically try to come to like a natural endpoint in the conversation where it says thank you. And now because you're telling me these things, I can surface a magnet, which is the scrapbook thing you see, or I'll surface a pattern. So you, it tells you quickly what you get out of it, what you saw in the app before. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:23
We took a bit more of an open ended approach which is a little bit more like Chat GBT as you described, where the AI is, I would say a little less specifically goal oriented, but more like let me just talk to Molina and explore different things that she might be curious about and what she is getting out of that chat might be more than what she initially came to it for, but it's a bit more like designed to be as long as you want it to be. Do you have any like preferences or thoughts about those two different approaches? 
M
MxL
21:02
Yeah, something useful for me would be that like, you know how Chat GPT works and I really like the chat GPT model, but I recently found Claude. Anyway, I would like for the conversations to kind of be safe because like, let's say you spend like, I don't know, an hour or whatever, like 30 minutes chatting with Peak, the AI thing and then like a few days later you have a question like coming out of nowhere and you want to go back to that conversation. I wouldn't want to start over. I really hate that. So I would like, oh, okay. For you to have like the chat there and then whenever you want you can go back to it and keep talking. Because starting over, I don't know, at least for me, I stopped using AI models that force me to start over. 
M
MxL
21:42
Or if it's like a premium feature and it cuts off and you have to start a brand new chat now I don't like that. So preferably, at least for something like this, I would want to have something like I said, where you can have the chat still over there at your convenience. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:58
Okay, got it. That's actually in. If you click on Compose, that would be the chat. 
M
MxL
22:08
But does it like keep the conversation in the. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:11
Oh, you mean like the, you want to keep the. 
M
MxL
22:15
Yeah, like let's say we go back and forth like 10 messages. Like for example, think email, like nothing is getting deleted. You can reference it anytime. My point is like if you talk right now and then like I don't know. Three days later you decide you have more questions about whatever else you were talking with Peak or like you have additional feedback or whatever you want to say. Can you still reference that old chat and anything feedback worthy? I was thinking anything that you're like, oh, my feedback for the app or like the website is this. And then that line is going to get sent to the developers or whatever so they can kind of keep updating the app or whatever. 
M
MxL
23:00
So it's a mutual benefit kind of thing where like you get to see what you're talking about and anything you say that's like, oh, I suggest this or I don't like this or whatever. Those lines specifically starting with phrases like that, are the ones that are getting sent. But anything else is more so private and still kept in the app. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:17
Okay, got it. Maybe I'll ask this way. Can you tell me how you're using ChatGPT and how you are using like what you've previously Talked to with ChatGPT as you continue the conversations? Just so I understand your, how your process and brain works there. 
M
MxL
23:41
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:46
You don't have to pull. Yeah. 
M
MxL
23:47
You don't have to pull up your entire chat. Figure out like a simple topic. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:51
Yeah. So you can take a look at it on your side without me seeing and like reference. Like I know that sometimes you know. 
M
MxL
23:59
Yeah, go ahead. My chats end up being complex though. I'm trying to figure something out that's easy to understand. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:07
Yeah, no problem. 
M
MxL
24:09
Okay. I guess one could be like, you know when you're working on a CV and you don't want to keep showing it to everyone, so you're like, okay, so I'm here a chat. Look at this. This is the job description. This is the CV I wrote. Can you give me feedback and like, let's say your job application or whatever is due in five days. So my point is like you have this conversation, this initial conversation that you're having at like 3:55pm on December 23rd, and then you think that you might be done talking about it for now. But then a few days later, before the job application is due, you have more questions and you edit your CV and you want to like have more feedback on it or whatever. So ultimately you can reference back to everything that was spoken. 
M
MxL
25:01
You could be like, okay, so the edit we did 3 days ago doesn't seem to be working because they changed this line in the job description. So I'm going to send you this again just so you can remember. And this is the part I don't like, because chat seems like it ends up like having memory issues or whatever. I don't know if that has to do with having too many chats, but I would want it to have, like, the initial important thing I'm talking about, still have it there and be able to continue days later and still have the initial conversation in there to keep continuing, starting over. You might, like, miss out important details that you said the first time or whatever. You get what I mean? 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:42
Yeah, yeah. Okay, that makes sense. So let me just try to understand what you are doing then Just let me know if this is the case. So you said that, like a couple of days later you're like, all right, I think that there's some edits I want to work on and I can still apply for this job. Are you actually going back to the original chat and just adding on to the original chat, or are you creating a new chat but then just referencing, hey, we talked about this five days ago. 
M
MxL
26:13
I don't like to create new chats because it seems the only time I have to do that is if it says you used your limit for. Okay, yeah, see, I don't like doing that because then it feels like you're telling the model all over again and it's going to act like it has no idea what you're saying. So I don't like that. So I try to use up, like, if we have one chat tab open, I will use it to the max, and then only when it does not allow me to, like, say more stuff, I will copy and paste, like, its most recent message, open a new tab, send it. I'll be like, you said this, but I still have more stuff to say or stuff to ask you. So I want you to continue from there. 
M
MxL
26:54
If you don't remember what we talked about in our previous chat, I can send it. But tell me what you're thinking of right now regarding what I sent. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:05
Okay, got it. That makes a lot of sense. So basically it's like, I mean, I guess it makes sense. Like, if you think about it from a people perspective, it would be kind of silly if, like, every time you met up with a close friend, they completely forgot about what you guys talked about the last time and you had. 
M
MxL
27:23
To, like, remind them. I mean, the very least is like the AI model at least could have, like, an idea of what you were talking about so you don't have to start over. So you could be like, oh, I spent again, back to spending. I spent $500 at TJ. Maxx or whatever. And I spent it on XYZ and a few days later, like, you're like, okay, so I found an alternative. These are the new prices. Can you tell me if this has, like, better value? Should I get this or whatever. And you don't want to keep referencing that. Like, let's say you're buying like 50 things, right? You don't want to keep typing out all of those 50 things that you purchased and now you're thinking of replacing 30 of them because you found a similar item. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. 
M
MxL
28:07
You want to have. I would like to have like some part of the conversations saved and not having to repeat it all over again. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:16
Got it, got it. How. How does this sound? Let's go back to the app here and I'll just like, I'll try my best to like, articulate verbally what this could look like. So click into Urban Outfitters. Maybe just click a. Yeah, click. Needed it or something. All right, so I try it out. Oh, that is not supposed to happen either. But that's okay. That's just a Maps. You can stay in here. I'm just trying to figure out how to do this. So Urban Outfitters, let's say somewhere you go to buy stuff. So instead of like, it's starting out with like a brand new chat, the first message is, hey, you spent like, you went to Urban Outfitters, like three times in the last three months. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:10
And the last time we talked, you told me that you really liked what you bought at Urban Outfitters because it was a gift for a friend. Tell me more about what you bought for today. Would that satisfy the feeling of, like, okay, this AI remembers me and like, has the context, or would you actually want to be able to, like, see, like, have more control over, like, what the start of the conversation thread looks like? 
M
MxL
29:43
I would like to have something that starts you off and I would like for that bit to be kept. Like, for example, what's your favorite breakfast treat? And you have like, I love croissants. So you have start having a conversation about croissants and like, where you want to buy them or where you bought them, whatever. And then I would like that bit to be kept. But then you have the ability to structure the conversation the way you want later on. And it's still going to be about food because to me, like, this whole chat right here, at least for this would have to be about food. So you're going to keep talking about food and it's going to keep tracking like, you Like XYZ foods or whatever and you buy them at these places and this is how much you usually spend on food. 
M
MxL
30:27
I don't know, maybe like the social thing were talking about that could also be a part of this, but I don't think it's as important. But like, you know, this would be like your food chat. Anything food related money spent on food would be all over here and you wouldn't be having these conversations deleted and you wouldn't be like starting all over again. So I think you should have like separate chat tabs. One is for food, one is for shopping, one is for, I don't know, going out with your friends. You know what I mean? But your conversations are not getting deleted. You can continue and add on anytime and new data from you is being put into the app and it's becoming more personable to you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:10
Okay, gotcha. Would you, let's say you're two weeks into using this app. Right. Would your expectation then when you start up a new chat that it's not going to start out being like, what's your favorite treat? It will have some kind of set of in this topic about food. Then you basically want that chat to feel like it already knows about all the conversations you've had about food and it's a continuation of that. 
M
MxL
31:37
Yes. I would even go as far as to like in the initial chat, I don't know how else it would start it, but maybe it learns like your food profile and it makes you like share what your most favorite food spots are and what places you're looking to avoid. So it learns what you like and don't like. And then from there we still kind of keep the whole conversation example that you gave me. We would have something like that. So it learned you. But the conversation never stops. It's always going to be about. You can have the food conversation today. It's still going to be available for you to reference two weeks later at your convenience. Another thing you don't have, like unlike ChatGPT, you wouldn't have to keep restarting. Yeah, I don't like that. 
M
MxL
32:22
I would stop using the app just because of that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:25
Okay, so basically right now, because it feels like you're restarting the chat, it already kind of turns you off. Yep. 
M
MxL
32:31
And that's why I got three other apps to replace ChatGPT. I was literally arguing with it the other day. I was like, I'm telling you all of this and you're completely acting like everything I'm saying is brand new to you. When you know, all of this, we've been talking about it for months because I was like. And I hope, like, you know, who wants to start over with that? It's kind of like talking to someone you've known for like 15 years and they act like they don't know you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:55
Oh, that is super annoying. Or like you're just like, you're like, I told you some very personal things. And like, it's like, it's not easy to say these things, but like. So, okay, that. That's super interesting because you also mentioned now you're using other apps instead of chatgpt. Like, which ones did you choose? And like, what do you like better about them? 
M
MxL
33:18
Like I said, Quad AI is the new one I'm using. However, I'm hating it right now because, I mean, the paywall thing is not it for me. It's worse than ChatGPT. So, like, you. The only thing I like is that it seems like it has no message limit. So I could send it like a whole essay, long text, where I'm really getting in there about like a topic. Right. And it will not cut you off, unlike ChatGPT, which I like. But then it's gonna. After that one big message or you send like a one liner, like two minutes later, it's gonna be like, okay, we're. Because you're not paying for premium, you're not gonna be able to talk to Claude until 8:00pm Okay, I don't like that. So I wouldn't want anything like that here either. So I would like the. At least. 
M
MxL
34:09
I don't know what the premium. I know peak has a premium version. I don't know what it looks like, but I would like that there's no like, time limit and there is no. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:16
Like. 
M
MxL
34:19
The word limit. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:22

Yeah, there's a. Let me try to see if I can find this. This is not related to the interview, but there's actually these sites. I think there's one called LLM arena, but you can Google some of them. But they are actually sites that wrap a bunch of these models up into one place. This one's called Battle, because you can actually run them. Like run multiple against each other. I think that you could use these in case you run out of limits with Claude. By the way, just sharing a little bit. 
M
MxL
35:00
Lol. Arena, you said? 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:02
LLM LM Arena. 
M
MxL
35:07
Arena. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:08
Yeah, I just sent it in the link. 
M
MxL
35:10
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:11
Ella, Marina, There's a bunch of these. I. I found some of them on Reddit actually as well, because you'll find a lot of people also complaining about rate limits and oh, I love Reddit. 
M
MxL
35:20
I'm. I love Reddit to this point. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:24
I love Reddit. It's, it's like, it's so useful, yet also very unhinged at the same time. But you get to see, I think it's a very, it's very useful. It's also very accurate depiction of how people feel about things sometimes. 
M
MxL
35:37
Yeah, they're unfiltered, which I like. And you don't have to like, try to figure out, oh, someone's purposely giving good feedback for no reason, just like, there's no incentive. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:49
Right. It's like, okay, like, it's anonymous. Like, you know, you just say these things. But I digress. So I guess going back to Claude, then it sounds like the main thing that you have an issue with Claude is just the paywall. But like, if that wasn't the issue, you would be like, you know what. 
M
MxL
36:09
I like, I would love to use it. I feel like it's more personable and I mean, there's an environmental factor. Apparently Claude doesn't contribute to like, you know, environmental issues like Chat GPT. But I really don't like this paywall thing that they have going on. And the thing is, I'm thinking of trying something out, asking ChatGPT to act like Claude, because I've done this before. I asked ChatGPT to act like, I don't know if you know the app named Robin. It's an AI with the bird. Well, that one is specifically for the model is trained to be more like human, like where, like, you know, there's empathy, validation and stuff. It is not going to B.S. You obviously kind of like a real person. 
M
MxL
36:54
But like, if you have like an emotional experience or like something you're analyzing with someone, that model is best for you. Again, there's like the chat limit. I don't know if it's like 60 messages and then you can't continue. You have to pay like $30 a month. So yeah, that's another thing. Asking Chat GPT to act like these Personas. Yeah, Gemini. Not that great for me. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:20
Why don't, why don't you like Gemini? 
M
MxL
37:24
I think it's too general. I don't know. It's too AI. Yeah, I don't like that. I think any AI model, for it to be successful and for me to continue using it, needs to be very conversational, learn you and act like it hasn't forgotten and you have to have the ability to continue talking to without having to restart a chat yeah. So any app that has a chat feature with an AI should have that according to my criteria. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:54
Yep, Gotcha. Have you seen the movie Memento before? 
M
MxL
38:03
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:04
It's just a bit of an older movie, but it's so good. But it's a story about a guy who does not have ability to save short term memory, so he forgets everything, like every 30 minutes to an hour. So he has to like tattoo reminders on himself or like. Right. Obviously this is pre iPhone era because I'm like, oh, like, I think you can obviously do a lot more with an iPhone. So just dating the movie. But it's interesting because when you're like, oh, it just like it. What annoys me about AI is like when it just forgets all the time. Every new chat it just reminded me of that movie where it's like, yeah, you basically have a new chat every one hour as a person. 
M
MxL
38:44
Oh. Another thing that I really don't like is when like you could say something completely normal and then it's like, this is a boundary I'm not willing to cross. But you have, but you haven't said anything that's inappropriate. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:58
This is on Gemini, right? 
M
MxL
39:00
This is on ChatGPT. It cut me off and I started arguing with it. Okay. And then I got so mad. That's where the other few apps started coming in. Because I was like, I'm telling you, whatever I'm saying is not unsafe. All I'm asking you is to take X perspective into consideration. We continue talking about it and you act like a normal AI model if you're going to keep doing that. And it started going back and forth with me. I ended up like getting really mad and deleted the app because of that. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:30
Yeah, yeah. 
M
MxL
39:32
So yeah, the chat GPT, like brand new fifth model is not it. Everyone hates it. According to my little research. Yeah, the fourth was better. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:45
Got it, got it. And. And you've seen that like. Cause other people. 
M
MxL
39:49
Yeah, I went on Reddit. Everyone was complaining. There's like a ton of YouTube videos where like they're complaining about it and trying to reset it, but there's no option. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:59
Yeah, I don't know if you can reset it now, but I don't know how well this works. You can. Have you tried custom instructions and chatgpt? 
M
MxL
40:12
I just learned about doing that the other day. I don't know if it's helping because I started a chat and I said, from now on you're gonna act normal. You're gonna have an empathetic approach, but you're not gonna agree with everything I say. And I, I don't know if I have to keep, say, putting this prompt into any chat that I start or if it's gonna. Remember that's kind of the issue. So if were doing something like that here, if I say it one time, I expect it to be in the system that one time I said it. And it's going to follow that kind of conversation pattern with any chat. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:43
Yeah, yeah. It's like, look, I'm putting an effort to, like, tell you about me. I expect, like, equal, if not more, like, value back that you, like, really listens to me so I don't have to keep doing it all over again. 
M
MxL
40:57
Yep. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:02
Got it. Got it. Now, speaking of the chat, since we're on that thread right now, like, let's take the. Let's just take TJ Maxx as the example because it's something you mentioned. Right. So let's say we're chatting. Actually, tell me the last time you bought stuff at TJ Maxx and what it was and I'll try to formulate the question. 
M
MxL
41:28
You know, I haven't. I don't even remember the last time I went to TJ Maxx, but that's the first thing or last. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:35
Last place you shot. Yeah, let's go with Macy's. 
M
MxL
41:37
Okay, Macy's. I'm there frequently because I love trying out new perfumes. And, you know, with online shopping, you don't have an idea of whether you're gonna like a scent or not. So at least when I'm using an AI, I could be like, okay, I'm going to tell you the kind of scents I like. This is what I have in my cart. This is the price. This is. I don't know, this brand is giving you, like, a makeup pouch and like a mini. Is this, like, gift worth it with this purchase? Should I find it somewhere else? Can you give me different retailers where I can explore different price points for me to purchase? So that, to me is really helpful. And I keep doing that with every single item in my cart. 
M
MxL
42:17
And yes, it does take a while, but to me, it is worth it doing this with every single item in my cart. So I would like to do the same thing here. But I don't know if a peak would have, like, a Google search kind of thing embedded in it. If it did, it would be great because I like to ask the AI models to give me alternatives. So, like, instead of spending, I don't know, 200 on your designer sweater. Is there an option for 125 somewhere else with free shipping? Shipping is an issue for me. I hate paying for shipping. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:55
Okay, gotcha. So back on like the pre purchase, basically like you making the decision. Let's actually think about you already made the purchase and then like what Pete can do because the, sorry, the, the current experience is designed for helping you after you made the purchase, which I know is one part of what's useful for you. The second part that you mentioned is super interesting. I'm going to have to go back and think about how we could design it. But let's just take the once. Do you remember like, I guess if you have the bank statement in front of you to reference, like do you remember the last time you went to Macy's? 
M
MxL
43:43
Maybe like sometime during the beginning of the month, I think. Okay, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:48
And all right, so. And do you remember what you bought? 
M
MxL
43:53
There was these two perfumes I was curious about. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:59
Okay. 
M
MxL
44:03
I didn't end up keeping either of them. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:05
Okay. 
M
MxL
44:07
But yeah, I'm frequently trying a lot of beauty products out instead of like clothes and stuff. Clothes for me? I don't know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:16
You like more like self care beauty. Like. 
M
MxL
44:18
Yeah, yeah. Okay. That's very central to my entire shopping experience and profile. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:25
Yeah, yeah, got it. So all right, so let's take this conversation about Macy's, right? So one approach, okay, I'll. I'll go with one approach and just ask you questions and then we'll go second approach. I'll ask you different set of questions and I'll ask you how you feel. All right, so approach one. What made you, so what made you decide to buy these two perfumes from Macy's? 
M
MxL
45:03
Well, Macy's has, I don't know if you're familiar with Macy's at all. You know the star money kind of thing where like you spend an X amount of money, like you spend every like let's say 200, you're gonna get $20 in star money. So that's like your fun money in Macy's. But if you return that $20 is obviously going back and like the return is going to be split into like the star money going back. Then it's like whatever else you paid with your card is going back to your cards. So that's a major thing with Macy's, at least for me. But most of the time if I see a brand offer where I'm like, okay, so if I buy this shampoo and like body wash, right. The brand is giving away a Makeup pouch and a body oil. 
M
MxL
45:50
So to me it's like, okay, so if I buy these two and I actually like the scent, I'm getting additional stuff because the brand is giving you a gift for trying out their products. So that is a major driver for me. I always go into the, like, the brands that are always giving something out because I'm like, I'm saving money this way. That's the way I think about it. If I like. Okay, if I buy a foundation and like a few brushes and the brand is giving you away, like a lipstick and an eyeshadow. Eyeshadow palette. You have like one third of your makeup routine already. Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:25
Okay. 
M
MxL
46:25
So that's kind of how I start going about it, at least with Macy's and any, like, retailer that has like a lot of beauty products. But I will always go to that tab where I see if the brand is like offering something valuable to me. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:40
Okay, gotcha. All right, let me try. What approach two would be like, what did you, what. What did you buy at Macy's? 
M
MxL
46:58
The most recent one? 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:00
Yes. 
M
MxL
47:02
Two perfumes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:03
Okay. 
M
MxL
47:04
And I hated both of them. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:05
Okay. And. 
M
MxL
47:10
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:12
Did you end up returning it? Yes. 
M
MxL
47:15
Okay. I wasn't planning to return it, but it smelled like old lady perfume, so that was. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:22
Okay. 
M
MxL
47:22
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:24
All right, so those are kind of two approaches. I don't know if you noticed. So approach one, I try to ask a more open ended question to just like have you chat with me however you wanted to chat. If you notice, I kind of just like sat back and then listened. Second approach is more like I'll ask very specific questions but then try to. 
M
MxL
47:46
Like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:48
Wrap the conversation up in like just a few responses to basically ultimately what we'll do with the app is like take those responses and then create a pattern for you so it's a bit more fast to seeing your pattern. The first one is more like, okay, let's make it more open ended and chat about things in a more like a broader way. Did you have a preference for like, either approach? 
M
MxL
48:18
Yes. I was gonna say I would love if these approaches were actually blended. I like the open end. I really like the open ended part, but I wouldn't want the AI model to respond in like one word like okay to everything you say. That would be annoying for me. I would like kind of like a normal flowing conversation where like if the AI wants to give you like a five sentence response, it's going to give you a five sentence response, not just. Yeah, okay, got it. That would be. But I also really like the specific questions. It gives me room to reflect and actually think about what I'm saying. So I would like both of those approaches to be merged into one, preferably in that order. 
M
MxL
48:59
So you start open ended, and then as the conversation flows and it starts learning you have these specific questions and it's not the one that decides when the conversation is ending. You decide when it's ending. You can be like, okay, got it. If I have any other questions, I'm gonna come back to this chat, or you just leave the chat, but it's still gonna be there for you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:22
Okay, got it. So basically, I guess this is similar to like how you have a conversation with a human. If you're catching up with a friend, usually you'll start with a general question of just like, hey, it's been like a month since I've seen you, like, how are you doing? And then it's like this opening and you can like answer it however you want. Or I guess like, if you know something about what they've done, you're like, oh, I saw that your brother visited a week ago. How was that? You wouldn't necessarily go straight into like, oh, tell me how you felt about this text message this person sent. Like that. Be like, yeah, yeah. So, okay, so basically it's you want to like, I guess the. I'm trying to break it down so. 
M
MxL
50:16
It shouldn't really feel too AI, if you will. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:18
I really should feel natural. Yeah. 
M
MxL
50:21
Conversation flow. It's not going to decide when you should shut up. You decide when you shut up. So because some AI start getting stubborn and they don't really want to engage, so you have to start a brand new chat, try to act all enthusiastic to get it to engage. I don't like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:37
Okay, okay. And so then my question to you is how would you feel most natural or what have you done before most naturally to let the AI know that you want to keep chatting? The reason why I asked this question is sometimes when AI is told to keep the conversation going, it'll keep asking more and more questions and keep engaging. And that could exhaust people sometimes. So is it like you want to. I don't. Safe word is the right word, but you're just like, okay, like, I'm good. Like, like, would you be the type to be like, I don't mind telling the AI like, this is, I'm good here. Do you want the AI to kind of figure that out a little bit better, but then use more Like, I. 
M
MxL
51:28
Guess, no, I wouldn't want it to be like, is this a good point to stop? I wouldn't like that. Because then it would feel like the AI is indirectly asking you to stop. Now, I don't know about that. But one thing I do know is if the AI continues saying like something I don't like. For example, like if you were talking and I was the AI and you're like, okay, I did this in Thailand. And it kept on saying, okay, I don't like that you had like this food because it's unhealthy and it keeps saying, this is a boundary I don't want to cross or whatever because I don't want to talk about this. Because you're gonna, I don't know, you're being stubborn and this food is gonna get you poisoned. And you're like, well, I'm not talking about that. 
M
MxL
52:09
And it keeps saying that I am always like there to be like, stop, I don't want to talk to you anymore. So I will stop. And then it will say something like, okay, if you don't want to talk right now, we can start a new topic. Or you can take some time off and relax. Now that would make me really mad, which it actually did a few days ago. But I don't hesitate to say stop when I don't like what it's talking about. As far as closing the conversation, I just stop responding. But the thing I like is that it's always there for me to go back to. And I just go back and act like we're not even starting all over again. I just continue. So I guess going back to like your trip example. 
M
MxL
52:48
So like, let's say you stop talking about your trip and then a few days later you're like, okay, So I forgot to note that during my trip I did xyz. And the conversation continues to flow normally. There is no pauses, there's no you saying bye. It's not gonna be like you have like, you know those computer systems that have like, oh, you haven't been on the website and it's going to close in 30 seconds. So I wouldn't want anything like that. I wouldn't want it to be like, we should stop here. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:17
Okay, got it. 
M
MxL
53:18
Decide. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:19
So do you ever get annoyed if like, let's say an AI like continues to ask follow up questions and invite you to keep chatting? Basically, it's like it gives you the opportunity to kind of be the one to be like, okay, like, I'm good. Like, do you ever get annoyed when it, like, let's say that assuming the questions are well phrased, right, like if the questions are like judgmental or like don't reflect, like clearly don't reflect an AI's understanding of you, then no amount of questions, even one question of that nature will annoy people, right? But let's just say these are well phrased questions, right? Like, maybe the intuition is like, you. Everyone has a friend who's a really good listener. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:05
You know, I have someone who's like, if I don't pay attention, like, I'll spend two hours talking about myself and I feel a little bit bad about it, but they're just such a good listener where they just keep asking questions and, oh, digging more. And I'm like, oh, I didn't think about that. Like, does that ever make you feel like, oh my gosh, I have to keep engaging, that's pressure. Or you actually kind of like that where you kind of get to guide. 
M
MxL
54:29
I actually like that. I think it kind of reflects how I approach, like, interactions with people. Even though I can engage first, I choose not to. And the only reason I choose not to is because I know I can hold a conversation and make it really genuine. But my goal is to see if someone else can do that for me. So I wouldn't get annoyed with the AI continuing to ask about me because I feel like it wants to know me more. But the thing is, the only thing that would kind of tick me off is how the question is asked. If it's like very on the surface, it's not really taking the time to properly learn about you. I will leave the chat and most likely get rid of an app. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:11
Yeah, yeah, got it. 
M
MxL
55:14
Yeah, Engagement is really important to me. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:19
Got it, got it. Okay, that makes total sense. All right, let me see. My headphones are kind of being weird. Let me just switch them. Oops. Okay, just dropped it. I actually think that might be most of the questions I have. I found it really interesting diving into the chat feature specifically. That's actually not where I thought everything would go, but it's been super interesting and is making me think through some of the designs of that a lot more. And like, thank you so much for providing that. Anything else, like, come to mind that you've feel like you haven't voiced yet around, like, how you like to interact with AI, how you like to talk about money? 
M
MxL
56:16
I was actually going to talk about the app, now that I think about it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:19
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah. 
M
MxL
56:23
So personally, I really do not like this new design that's been updated in the app. I feel like the initial design with like multiple stuff on your, like the app's home screen, if you will, was more fun for me. But now it's like limited to like two things and I didn't really like that in another. First thing I was thinking is I don't know if I was thinking from like a space efficient perspective, but I don't know the. How the layout would feel if it was like more horizontal where you can see everything at once. You know, like those planners and stuff. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:58
Yeah. 
M
MxL
56:59
Where it's like you can see everything at once and you'll only scroll down for like, I don't know, contact information, premium or whatever. So stuff like that would be on the bottom but most of like the apps stuff would be horizontal and you can see almost everything at once. So that was another thing wanted to know. But I think I said everything about the AI and how I would want to have it. Then there is of course like the now again, not really mandatory probably, but I would really like the point system, reward, whatever and the only. And then I can't really say much about anything else until I have an idea of what the premium looks like because only then would I be able to like compare and contrast what I like and don't like. But as far as everything else. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:45
Yeah. 
M
MxL
57:45
The apps layout is like my main thing. Spoke a lot about the AI. Do we have like other stuff here? What else do I want to know? 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:57
Do you prefer like, maybe I'll just try to ask, like, do you prefer this kind of layout more here or over this layout? 
M
MxL
58:07
Over which one? 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:08
Over the. The prototype. So this one, the purple one, this. 
M
MxL
58:13
One over the one that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:16
Yeah. So this is the current app, the one that you've seen, right? This is what you remember? I'm putting it on my. Sorry, I'm. 
M
MxL
58:26
Why? You know what, Let me just pull up that. I didn't even think there were any changes. Maybe it's because I haven't been on that for like the last few days except last night. But right here I'm currently seeing, you know, hello, Milena. And then there's like your peak aura. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:45
Yeah. 
M
MxL
58:45
Then there's like this streak and then it's just your daily vibe. But what I recall is that the last, the very first meeting there was a lot more to see on the screen. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:55
Oh, okay. Yeah, okay, Got it. That makes sense. Now, assuming the app has like more cards. 
M
MxL
59:05
Right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:06
It's just the layout plus like maybe like three more things. How do you like that? Compared to, like, I guess, the more planner type of approach, which is closer to what you see on the website, but where you see more things on the screen. Right. Like, do you have a preference between the two? 
M
MxL
59:31
It's going to sound weird, but ideally it would depend on the mood. I would like the option to switch back and forth between the layout type. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:38
Okay, got it. 
M
MxL
59:39
And that would be great. Now, the website design for me looks great, but I think you sent me, like, a different link last time where I could see more stuff all over here, which I really liked. Okay. Like, you just scrolling up and down like this. So, like, having a lot of stuff right here for me personally would be great. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:59
Okay, got it. 
M
MxL
01:00:03
I don't think there's anything else I wanted to know. I do like these things. It's kind of like a stamp kind of feature thing or whatever. Another thing I guess I could say is, like, I don't know if this could be gamified to create more engagement on the app just from, like, the aesthetic perspective, just for, like, engagement from people. So, like, keep everything else as it is right now, but make it more gamified. Have, like, a reward system, get the AI to engage more option to switch back and forth between, like, the layouts. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:00:40
Yeah. 
M
MxL
01:00:40
And I don't know. I guess I don't know if. What does the premium feature have that the current feature does not? 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:00:53
I mean, currently the. The premium button is really just there, but there's actually no difference. So everyone has the same thing. Yeah. 
M
MxL
01:01:00
Oh, okay. Okay. No, I've been so curious. I was like, could you customize stuff? Because I couldn't tell I was about to sign up for the premium. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:01:07
Yeah, yeah, there's a. There's not that yet. I'll let you know, though, once I do have to go because I have a meeting right now. But thanks for your time. And then we'll follow up on the payment since everything kind of finished full circle as well. But feel free to reach out if you have any questions and if we have more testing or things to do in the future, like more stuff to show, like, we're happy to reach out and open to it.
