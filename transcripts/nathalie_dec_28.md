Nathalie

Thank you.

Sherry Jiang

Hi, Natalie. 
N
nathalie Ortega
00:03
Hi, Sherry. How are you? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:05
I'm good, I'm good. Good to speak again. Yes. I don't know if Jeff jumped into the rundown, but I'm happy to give that at the beginning. 
N
nathalie Ortega
00:18
That's awesome. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:19
Okay, so great. So last time we spent more time just getting to know you more in general. And then we had one initial app that we ran through with you. So the last couple of weeks we spent a little bit more time and have something else to review to get your feedback today. So that will be the bulk of how we're going to be spending the time. Just a reminder of how things went last time. Just kind of pretend that we're not really here. When you're using the app, like, think about what you would naturally gravitate towards doing versus what you think we should have you be looking at and then be like, you know, voicing how you think honestly out in your head. Pretend there's a microphone to your brain and you're just like, oh, this is interesting. Or, oh, this is cute. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:04
Or this is kind of weird. 
N
nathalie Ortega
01:05
I don't know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:05
I don't really get this. Unstructured is totally fine. And we'll try to stay quiet. Generally as you're going through stuff, we may come and answer questions or ask some questions here or there. But by and large, we want this to be mostly just, like, led by you and your own thoughts as you're going through the app. Any questions about this before we begin? 
N
nathalie Ortega
01:28
Is it going to be similar from last time where I upload and look over my. Okay, I have an email of my most recent pay statement that I uploaded today, this afternoon to my email. 
J
Jeff Min
01:45
Okay. Do you upload it to the previous application link or. 
N
nathalie Ortega
01:50
Oh, I need that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:52
Yeah, we have something new we can share, which Jeff can do. 
J
Jeff Min
01:56

Okay, I'm just going to give you a URL and similar to previously, you can log in with your Gmail. 
N
nathalie Ortega
02:30
Oh, do you have to share my screen? 
J
Jeff Min
02:33
That would be good, yes. 
N
nathalie Ortega
02:35
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
02:43
Is this a statement from last month? I suppose, yes. Okay, great. 
N
nathalie Ortega
02:51
So it's still processing, but I would. It should come up soon, I think. 
J
Jeff Min
02:57
Okay, we're on your Gmail screen. 
N
nathalie Ortega
03:00
Oh, okay. 
J
Jeff Min
03:03
There we go. It should. It takes about a minute and a half. There we go. All right, I'm going to mute myself and then let you go through it like the last time. 
N
nathalie Ortega
03:17
Okay. I don't. I thought we've already did this where I thought I uploaded the most recent one. 
J
Jeff Min
03:42
Oh, sorry. This is a totally different application. So whatever you did Before. Would it be part of the process? Okay, pretend. Just imagine that you're uploading this for the first time. You don't have to go through everything, but just click through a couple of buttons. I know that you've already done it before, but this is a separate or an updated experience that we wanted to test. 
N
nathalie Ortega
04:04
Okay. Do I click anything? 
J
Jeff Min
04:06
Yeah, you can click on peek again. There you go. Yeah, it'll go back. What we did was we took some of the feedback and also from others, and then we updated the app a little bit so it will look different and this is a separate experience altogether. 
N
nathalie Ortega
04:28
Oh, okay. All right. No, It. 
J
Jeff Min
06:56
Sorry. For the purposes of the kind of prototype, you'll have to go through the onboarding or rather the tutorial to get to the next stage. So if you. Earlier, I know that you dismissed the tutorial. Yeah, don't mind. Just go through that. Because some of the questions that we're going to ask later on will be about that as well. 
N
nathalie Ortega
07:16
All right, let me. So how do I go back all the way? 
J
Jeff Min
07:22
Yeah, just click on any of these available buttons. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:32
I'm actually kind of curious, Natalie, what made you initially actually dismiss the message when it popped up? 
N
nathalie Ortega
07:39
Just out of curiosity, I thought that was. It wasn't necessary to write anything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:44
Okay, got it. So you were like, you know what, let's skip and I'll go to the next one. Yeah, okay, got it. 
N
nathalie Ortega
07:51
But you do want me to write something, right? 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:55
Right now? Yes. But previously. That's okay. If that's like, what you were thinking. Naturally. 
N
nathalie Ortega
08:01
Yeah. I can't remember. What was this? 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:18
What was that? 
N
nathalie Ortega
08:43
So it's asking me for my favorite breakfast tree. Like, do I actually write answer for that? 
J
Jeff Min
08:47
Or you could just click on I love croissants. I would love to understand at the end if you understood what this process was trying to do, at least these steps. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:51
Hey, Natalie. Just wanted to do a quick check. Since you've clicked on a few things, what are some thoughts going through your head before we proceed? 
N
nathalie Ortega
13:00
I wanted to read what those are when I was opening them. So if it's going to take me to the page or was going to ask me questions, but it just said things that maybe kind of align what I was hoping to get out of my purchases. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:17
Yeah, got it. 
N
nathalie Ortega
13:26
No. All right, open that one. Sorry. 
J
Jeff Min
14:09
That's okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
14:44
Oh, I do remember something. The last time when we last spoke, there was a two purchases I made. I didn't know what they were. And then I just remembered a couple days after the call, we had and it was for the pharmacy. So now I remember. It sometimes takes a while to remember things when I really look back into it. 
J
Jeff Min
15:08
Is there anything that the app could do to help you like re trigger that memory? 
N
nathalie Ortega
15:14
What I purchased? 
J
Jeff Min
15:16
Yeah. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:20
So you mean like if the app asks you the question, hey, what did you purchase that helps you like trigger that within your head and then you're like, okay, let me go find out what that is and that then in turn helps you remember. 
N
nathalie Ortega
15:33
Yeah. Or like if it like an address of somewhere that I can look up on Google Maps. That's what I had. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:41
Okay, I see. Makes sense. 
J
Jeff Min
15:45
Would it help if the address. Because it's going to be quite difficult, especially if the pharmacy was a chain pharmacy. Right. Because there's going to be a lot of different places. But would it help if it guessed and give you like, let's say two or three options? Hey, you know, like Natalie, like these could be the places that you visited, for example. 
N
nathalie Ortega
16:06
It could help like what did help me when I was looking back in my statement was the title of the store and I just put the store name in UK and it came up the pharmacy. Like, oh, now I remember why. Why I didn't remember what it was. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:26
Okay, so you put the pharmacy in Google and then you saw the address and then you're like, oh, okay, this is from the uk. Yes, interesting. Got it, got it. I have a second question, but I'll let Jeff follow up. 
J
Jeff Min
16:43
Oh no. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:44
Oh, okay. If there was the ability for, let's say. Okay. Because obviously one way to remember things is you have a way to search it up later on, like go to Google. If part of using peak is basically helping you like create meaning or write these notes about these spends within like a day or two after. Right. Like so imagine, I think this is what month were you in the UK again? 
N
nathalie Ortega
17:22
November. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:23
November. So I guess imagine like the day after you went to the pharmacy in November. It peak was like, hey, what was this for? And then you did that exercise knowing that helps you remember things on an ongoing basis. 
N
nathalie Ortega
17:37
Do you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:38
Would you want to be able to like get reminders to do that? 
N
nathalie Ortega
17:42
Yeah, that way I knew but it was purchasey and like let's say I went back to my statement a few days later, like, wait, what was this? I don't remember going here. And if I can't go back to the trace, like even googling the place, like what. How did I even get. Get this purchase? Like very small things. I'll give an example. Last year I Went to a boutique store, and I bought a very nice blazer that was $62. But on the transaction, it doesn't say the store's name. I think it said first name. And I'm like, wait, why did I spend this much to this person? Where did this come from? And then I would have to, like, really think hard to say where the thing. Where did that transaction come from? Is this something I got myself into without realizing? 
N
nathalie Ortega
18:28
Did I pay for something? Did I did anything? That's what I'm, like, trying to go back. Like, where did this come from? 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:36
Got it, got it. 
N
nathalie Ortega
18:37
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:37
And I mean, obviously the earlier after things happen, the easier it is to remember. But, like, sometimes when, like a month or so passes, it's hard to trace, because I think you mentioned the. The transaction names or sometimes that you get on your bank statement, like, doesn't really match, like, what you can find about it. 
N
nathalie Ortega
18:58
Yes. And there's been times I call my bank saying, hey, what is this? Like, oh, okay, fraud. I'm like, I don't know yet. Let me find out before I claim it as fraud. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:09
Oh, okay, got it. You, like, recall, like, maybe one time you called the bank and like, how do they eventually help you trace what the spend was? 
N
nathalie Ortega
19:20
That's when I went to the boutique and I. I guess I bought it sometime in February, and I realized I was in March. And that's when I saw my. Wait, what is this for? Then they told me the day I purchased, and I'm like, okay, now I remember. I got this at a store. That's why I have this showing up on my statement. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:47
Okay. In the bank statement, you didn't have the day of purchase originally. 
N
nathalie Ortega
19:52
I guess I didn't click it to see the date of purchase, but I was more focused. Like, what is this transaction? 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:59
I see, I see. And then when they were like, oh, this happened, like, Saturday, February, whatever, the third weekend, you're like, oh, okay. Like, I remember what I did that third weekend. This is. That was the day. Now it clicks for me that this is what the sending was for. 
N
nathalie Ortega
20:14
Yes. And that's why I get nervous because I don't want to claim fraud before confirming it is a fraud. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:21
Right, right. 
N
nathalie Ortega
20:22
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:22
And now that case, like, you're like, oh, okay, I actually just bought it. I just forgot that. Yeah, okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
20:30
Same with credit cards, too. I sometimes don't remember which payment I use. And I'm like, wait, what's this coming from? Why am I getting charged for this? How come this is appearing not on my, you know, Debit card. Like, oh, I charged it on the wrong card by accident. Yeah, it's more like remembering what I use I purchased and when I did it. 
J
Jeff Min
20:56
Got it. If you scroll up on your screen, do you. Do you think that some of these questions could help you to trace those eventually? Let's say this popped up, right? I don't know, a day after you made the purchase, in this little box at the top, would you be willing to answer some questions knowing that it could help you trace back later? 
N
nathalie Ortega
21:25
Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
21:27
And in that experience, would you be willing to upload a picture of what you purchased? 
N
nathalie Ortega
21:33
Like, right now? 
J
Jeff Min
21:35
Not right now, but imagine we had that feature where you can upload photos. 
N
nathalie Ortega
21:40
Like, where, like, what will the pictures be of? 
J
Jeff Min
21:45
Could be a receipt. Could be a picture of what exactly what you purchased. 
N
nathalie Ortega
21:50
Yeah, that could be helpful. 
J
Jeff Min
21:53
All right. Do you tend to take photos and receipts? 
N
nathalie Ortega
21:57
I usually keep them or keep the email. 
J
Jeff Min
22:01
Oh, you keep the email. Okay, great. Okay, that is helpful. Right. Because one of the things that we could eventually do is to pull up potential receipts from the email and match it against the transactions from the bank statement. 
N
nathalie Ortega
22:17
Yes. 
J
Jeff Min
22:18
Okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
22:18
I know what I've been doing lately is most places do, like, paperless receipts. I just send it to my email, keep it forever long. I have that way I can remember, like, oh, I remember buying this. This is not a transaction that I am aware of that I bought. 
J
Jeff Min
22:39
Right. 
N
nathalie Ortega
22:40
Happens. 
J
Jeff Min
22:42
Gotcha. Okay. I noticed that most of these transactions are probably related to your trip to London. 
N
nathalie Ortega
22:51
Yes. 
J
Jeff Min
22:52
Because that was the week that you were overseas. Okay. I have a question there. So if you scroll down and click on any of the weeks, let's say November 24th to 30th. The first one. 
N
nathalie Ortega
23:08
Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
23:10
How do you understand about the first section, things you love and what do you like when you read this? What do you think the feature would do? 
N
nathalie Ortega
23:28
I guess like normal routines that you're used to. Like, for example, if you buy coffee every day at the same spot, the same order drink, that could be something you love that will show up there. 
J
Jeff Min
23:39
Okay, cool. And. And when. I mean, is that, oh, sorry, go and go on to go to merchants. 
N
nathalie Ortega
23:49
Could be a store you go to. Doesn't have to be like retail. It could be food. It could be basically like anywhere that you constantly go back and notice that you make those the same purchases. 
J
Jeff Min
24:02
Okay. Okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
24:12
The only thing I can think of here, if you have like Venmo and you keep sending person money every time or they send you money. That's what I can really think of. 
J
Jeff Min
24:21
Okay. It's also exactly it. All right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:24
Do you have examples, I mean, not sure in this particular statement, but do you have examples of, like, people you can think of immediately that you tend to, like, do a lot of Venmo transactions with? 
N
nathalie Ortega
24:37
I sell my mom a lot. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:39
Okay, got it. And so that would be something you would, like, want to be able to see more noticeably. 
N
nathalie Ortega
24:49
Yeah. Just in case, like, if I Venmo someone money, I'm like, oh, what? Why did I send you money for? If it's like a night out, I'm like, oh, I send you this much. Why? 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:02
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
25:06
Got it. What was I going to say? You could actually click on this row called. I think you earlier labeled it as friend, so it'll show up. Really? But if you click on that purplish row at the top. Yeah, yeah, that one. 
N
nathalie Ortega
25:26
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
25:28
Yeah. These are all imaginary data, so this is not your real data. How do you feel about being able to share these things with friend? So let's say this friend is called Sandra. Whatever. Would you. What do you think about being able to share photos of the places that you've been to, of the things that you did together, like, I don't know, getting a coffee, getting dinner, etc. And being able to share with Sandra? 
N
nathalie Ortega
25:58
I think it's like a little cute feature that you can see the time you spend with your friends, what you guys did together, the drinks you got show what you just having a quality time with your friend and help you remember where you guys went to that day. Because sometimes I would go out with friends. I don't remember every spot we hit, but it's good to remember where went and see what we got. And that's how I was able to make that I purchased that item. 
J
Jeff Min
26:30
Okay. Okay, cool. Is there anything more that you would want out of something like this? 
N
nathalie Ortega
26:38
Maybe you show how much each item was. I spend on each item. 
J
Jeff Min
26:42
Okay, so like a collection of receipts or transactions, maybe, like, it could be. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:48
Like a cute little price tag maybe attached to it. 
N
nathalie Ortega
26:52
Yeah, like. Like a green that shows the amount you spend and then how. Maybe how long ago, what time you bought it? 
J
Jeff Min
26:58
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:59
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
27:00
Sort of like a timeline. And then where and how much? Okay. Would you expect to see that as a list or would you expect to be able to click on any of these stickers or magnets and then see a list of transactions that way? 
N
nathalie Ortega
27:18
I would want, like, two tabs or, like two options. One you can click on the sticker and see the price, and then the other tab goes from the first thing you bought that day to the last thing you bought that day. 
J
Jeff Min
27:30
Okay. Okay. So, like a calendar. Ish. 
N
nathalie Ortega
27:33
Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
27:34
Okay, gotcha. Yeah. It feels like a bank statement that you share with your friend, basically. 
N
nathalie Ortega
27:41
Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
27:43
Okay, cool. All right. How do you also feel about being able to collect these magnets? 
N
nathalie Ortega
27:54
They add a nice touch. It shows that what you. You can notice a pattern what you constantly spend on. Like, for example, if you see, like, the croissant here, you see constant that. That feature. Let me show that you buy croissants or you go to the bakery a lot. 
J
Jeff Min
28:19
And if. I mean, I know this is not your data. This is all, like, pretend data, but how would that make you feel if you suddenly start seeing these little things popping up? 
N
nathalie Ortega
28:29
I would be like, oh, I didn't know. I constantly go get croissants a lot. I wouldn't be opposed to not keep eating them. But I'm like, okay, that's. I didn't know I ate that a lot. And it's a good. Like, good to notice. 
J
Jeff Min
28:45
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:47
So for you, it's like, you just want to be able to, like, clock some of these things that you might not just, like, notice day to day. And it's not necessarily like, oh, I'm gonna, like, go change anything quite yet. But, like, that's like, the first step to just at least knowing what you're doing. 
N
nathalie Ortega
29:03
Yeah. You're more aware now rather than someone telling you, hey, you're buying a lot of X, Y, and Z's, you're noticing on the. This. On the app that these. These stickers, you're buying so much of them that. So someone's not calling you out. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:18
So you're kind of like, I'm kind of, like, in a way, calling myself out on it, but just seeing it visually versus having someone, like, tell me. It's like it's showing versus telling in a way. 
N
nathalie Ortega
29:30
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:31
Okay. Jeff. Yeah. You had a question? 
J
Jeff Min
29:37
Oh, yeah. So if you are seeing this more regularly, right. So let's say you've been seeing croissants for, I don't know, three weeks in a row. Right. Would that make you feel more guilty so that I. You stop spending, or would you say that you would appreciate seeing that and you realize you really like croissants and then you would just continue spending, which option do you think would happen? 
N
nathalie Ortega
30:03
I think for me, I would be like, oh, I really spending a little too much. I'm not a little. I'm spending too much on the croissants. Why am I keep Doing this. And then that's where you start thinking, is this impulse? Is it. Do I need it? Is it one? Is it a routine? Can I break out of little things that I'll notice about myself? 
J
Jeff Min
30:23
Okay. And how can we help you to go through that process? Or is this process something that you would prefer to do on your own? You know, just mentally process it by yourself? 
N
nathalie Ortega
30:36
There are some people who can do cold turkey and some people who would need, like, a hiatus from taking, you know, buying coffee all the time. So there could be like maybe a little. An announce little thing on the side that says, hey, we know that your percent of sale weekly sales are this much on croissants. Do you feel it's not to keep doing this all the time? 
J
Jeff Min
31:02
Okay. It's just a little nuts. 
N
nathalie Ortega
31:05
Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
31:05
But okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
31:07
How. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:08
How would you feel like, if you were. So there's a bunch of, like, icons here, let's say, like, okay, you saw that you bought a lot of croissants, and then you're like, you know what? Like, I'm still trying to figure out, like, what I want to do with this information, but I'm noticing it's a pattern. What if you had the ability to, like, pin croissant and it just tracks it specifically, it doesn't tell you like, oh, like, buy less or buy more. But it just makes you notice it a bit more than like, here. Or do you want it to be a little bit more like, I guess proactive and like, be like, you know what? Like, we can set a budget or whatever. 
N
nathalie Ortega
31:50
I would, for me personally would like, if there was like, some sort of. Way to tell me you spend. This is your sales on your spending sales on croissants. This year you spend 34 average than you usually do in any given type of the year. And that group me, for me, be concerned, like, oh, I would never spend that much in a year. How can I go from 0% to like, 34% on buying croissants? Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:19
Okay. So for you, it's more like the. The data and the evidence around your behavior is far more important than just getting advice on, like, okay, here's what you should be setting so you feel like as long as you see the numbers, you can start figuring out yourself how you want to, like, I guess. 
N
nathalie Ortega
32:42
Change that behavior if you decide pretty much that way. I'm more aware how much I've been spending my money on croissant rather than versus other items that I compared it to. Like, if I buy croissants, over coffee the whole year. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:00
Okay. You got it? Got it. 
N
nathalie Ortega
33:38
Okay. Is there anywhere else I should go? 
J
Jeff Min
33:44
No, actually, this is it. I wanted to ask you about something. Oh, yes. So below each, I guess, the week dates, there's a little description, like, you know, on October 27th to this, like, cozy coffee, Chipotle, et cetera. Is that helpful? 
N
nathalie Ortega
34:12
Yeah, it helps me remember, like, what I was getting that week and what I was spending on. I can start remembering. Okay. I got this because of this reason, and I got that because of that. 
J
Jeff Min
34:30
Okay. It's like a. I don't know, like a little trigger to your memory. 
N
nathalie Ortega
34:37
Yeah. Because I won't. 
J
Jeff Min
34:38
Is there anything. Yes, go on. Sorry. 
N
nathalie Ortega
34:41
Let's say we. This was like. If you actually. What did you buy? September. I can't really remember the five things I remember. I bought a September. Yeah. This will help me go back to be like, oh, that day. I got this. And I also got that week. And. Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
34:57
Okay. Gotcha, gotcha. Is there anything more helpful that we can be doing from that? Let's call it summary. Is there any more information that we could add to that summary? 
N
nathalie Ortega
35:11
Probably just a list of dates of when I went to buy, like, the Chipotle and the coffee and all that kind of stuff. 
J
Jeff Min
35:20
Okay, gotcha. Is that something like. If you scroll all the way to the bottom of this page, is that something like that transactions section? 
N
nathalie Ortega
35:33
Probably. I would probably like. We want to see how many times I bought a certain item that week. 
J
Jeff Min
35:42
Okay. Okay. So like two times. Chipotle this week. Okay. Okay, gotcha. Okay. I don't think I have any further questions. Sherry? 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:54
Yeah, I had a couple. Number one is what made you curious about checking things out in September? Because that's, I guess, now three months ago or two months ago. So I'm, like, curious about your thought process for wanting to, like, look back on to September. 
N
nathalie Ortega
36:13
So, like, September, I wasn't really employed yet, so I was, like, very wary about my spending. And I like to compare, like, how much I have, you know, saved in September versus now. Since I'm working now, I can, you know, spend more than I. I really could back in September. That way I am like, all right, September, I was doing well. I was not going crazy on spending. That's good. Good for me. I'm able to say I did save, and then fast forward, we're in December. All right, I'm making more money now. I can spend. I really want to. It's not necessary, but I'm glad I was having the decision of not to Overspend, Compare. I can do now. Now I can. Back then, I could never. I really couldn't. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:01
I got it. 
N
nathalie Ortega
37:02
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:04
How true do you feel, like, is the feeling that you wanted to look back at September to basically create a sense of, I guess, a sense of understanding of how your December spending is in comparison? Because you said that, you know, they're different in terms of whether or not you were employed. So we're using that as, like, a data point to figure out if you're spending right now is reasonable. 
N
nathalie Ortega
37:33
Pretty much, yeah. If I was spending the way I'm spending now, September, I. It would just make no sense for me to do that. Wouldn't be ideal. I'll just say it won't be. Ideally to have to spend, like, I don't know, Chipotle four times a week in September versus now. I can do it now. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:53
Okay, got it. So you were basically, like, almost like, I guess, creating a justification for the things that you are doing now to be like, hey, like, natalie in December, 4 chipotle is a week. That's cool. I'm good with that. 
N
nathalie Ortega
38:06
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:07
Natalie back in September. 
N
nathalie Ortega
38:09
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:09
She wasn't doing that. I'm kind of like, this seems reasonable, basically. 
N
nathalie Ortega
38:14
Yeah. Now I'm more comfortable in my finances compared to September because my situation. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:21
Right, right. 
N
nathalie Ortega
38:23
Is spending four times a week in Chipotle necessary? No. Can I afford to do it now? 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:28
Yeah, yeah. Got it, Got it. You're like, you know, I can do it now, and it makes me happy. So. And I'm making money, so, like, whatever. That sounds like, it's good. 
N
nathalie Ortega
38:37
Even though I did spend, like, Chipotle three times this week. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:42
Yeah, got it. 
N
nathalie Ortega
38:45
Oh, sorry. I was. In October, I was doing better, but not as good as now. December, November was, you know, I. I was able to start to do that, kind of being more comfortable in my spending November versus, like, August, September. So now I'm like. We're like, all right, the income is coming through. Spending now is fine. But back then, now. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:09
Got it, got it. And when you, like, I guess, checked September and then compared it to December, what feeling, like, went through your head? 
N
nathalie Ortega
39:19
Like, what did you feel more at ease, Relax. I can finally get what I really wanted in September now because I have the finance to do it. I'm still wary about what I'm spending on. But what I'm. I'm glad. I'm like, okay, now I don't have to be. 
J
Jeff Min
39:40
Wait. 
N
nathalie Ortega
39:41
I don't have to wait three weeks for a paycheck to Buy this thing now. I could wait a few days. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:47
Yeah, gotcha. So basically, like, a sense of happiness, pride, relief. And you said something interesting because you were like, okay, now I can like, buy something within a couple of days versus wait like three weeks for a paycheck. Would you say that's like, generally the way that you think a lot about some purchases? 
N
nathalie Ortega
40:12
It depends on the purchase. Okay. It depends if I'll give you an example. Like, sometimes I couldn't really get my nails done so often, but October came through my. All right, I can get my nails done twice a month now instead of once a month, so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:32
Okay, Gotcha. And how about, like, other, like, shopping purchases? If you can think of an example of, like, I think you might have given an example of a retainer, but I'm not sure if I'm remembering correctly. But do you have others that you can remember, like, oh, you know, I feel good when I look back compared to now because I can get this thing, like, faster. 
N
nathalie Ortega
41:03
Yeah. So I did get my retainers. I was able to buy them. Yes. And I felt good. Having to pay them off right away versus doing a payment plan because you can get that payment out of the way versus having to pay a certain amount per month. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:23
So payment plan, like through, like, something like after pay, or was it through the. 
N
nathalie Ortega
41:29
It was called cherry, this third party payment process. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:33
Okay, gotcha. And if you found a way, like, obviously, like, you know, you get more money through two ways. You make more money or you save more money. Right? 
N
nathalie Ortega
41:48
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:48
So if you were able to, like, find habits, let's say the croissant one, just as an example. Right. Found that this croissant habit was costing this and you were doing it four times a week or whatever. If you did not go get these croissants, you would have. You'd be able to buy. You'd be able to do your nails four times. Actually, you probably don't need to do that. But you can get your hair done like, once a month. Right. Would that feel motivating to be able to understand how that kind of. I guess for sure. 
N
nathalie Ortega
42:21
Because if you think about, like, getting food at all time, they're going to be there no matter how many days of the week, the food would always be there. But getting your hair done, you can't always do that just because it adds up. Of course. But getting your hair once a month after not having spending so much on, like, food, drinks. All right, I get to do this for myself because I really want it. I avoided Spending, you know, let's say croissants, $4. Four times $32 a week in croissants. That $32 end up going to my hair salon. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:53
Mm. 
N
nathalie Ortega
42:57
Now being said, the hair going to the hair salon doesn't cost $32. However, what you didn't spend on the croissants will go towards saving up for the hair salon. Yeah, Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:17
Let's see my other question. So now it totally makes sense, like, why you were looking at September as a comparison. I'm just wondering, like, how far back, like, if you were to look at like all these boxes that we have, right. Week by week, like, how far back do you feel like at some point you'll be like, okay, I don't really care about what happened like six months ago or nine months ago. Like, what's that point? 
N
nathalie Ortega
43:47
The furthest I ever looked back at A would probably be like two years ago. Okay. That's the first I'll ever look back because I'm not the same person who I was in 20, 23 or 22. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:02
Yeah. 
N
nathalie Ortega
44:04
Maybe the furthest I'll go back is like two years. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:07
Okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
44:08
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:10
Got it. Let's take six months as an example. Like, I guess that was like May, June, what would be the reason why? Or I guess what was the last time you saw yourself actually going back to like a six month period to like, figure something out related to money? 
N
nathalie Ortega
44:36
I feel like, I think a few. A few weeks ago I went back to see my August payments. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:42
Okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
44:44
That's when I graduated. And I think I was. What I was really trying to do was trying to compare, like, since I was done working, I graduated. I want to see how in that time versus how much I have now. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:00
Yeah. 
N
nathalie Ortega
45:00
And see, like, all right, where did everything, you know, make me become more aware of my spending? Because back then I was able to spend more than I was in September. This was. Yeah. Forgot what I was looking up for. But I did notice, like, the transactions I made. I said, okay, this makes sense why I was able to do what I wanted to do in August versus, like middle September of this year. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:27
Gotcha. Gotcha. That makes sense. So they seem to be tied to like, I guess, changes in your own life. Because August was like graduation. And then like recently, like, your employment situation also changed. So that's like another like, I guess, life stage change. So it's not just strictly, I guess, the number or the month itself or the number of months back, but it's like, I guess, meaningfulness based on like, how different was your circumstance? 
N
nathalie Ortega
45:53
Right. Life was changing. I'm becoming no more a college student. I am my own. I'm more, I'm no longer a college student called because I just graduated and I that point, like, did I like going out for bubble tea back then? Of course. But I wouldn't go out as often as I could now. And that's where I was trying to see. Okay, why did I not go to get X, Y and Z at that time versus I can do it more often now. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:25
Got it, got it. So basically like these kind of points of change, it got you to like sit down and reevaluate some of the different things that you do now versus before. 
N
nathalie Ortega
46:37
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:40
Got it. And then my next question is related to something you said about like being able to see the list of dates that you made purchases for like a merchant. So let's just use Chipotle as an example. Right. So it's like click on Chipotle and you know, you go to Chipotle a couple times a week and then here are the dates when you said you wanted to see that view. Was it being able to see that across multiple months versus just within the same month? 
N
nathalie Ortega
47:14
Maybe multiple months. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:17
Okay. And what do you feel like you get additionally insight being able to see like how you spent in Chipotle since let's say September versus like just looking at Chipotle in December. 
N
nathalie Ortega
47:35
Oh, I'll definitely see a few changes. Like in September we get like chicken, which is no cost. Now I'm getting stink steak. That's like a four dollar cost. Okay. Would not add an additional four dollars to my food. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:50
Okay, got it. So basically at a multiple month sort of scale, you're able to actually see like the decision that you made where. Okay, now that like I'm getting more of a paycheck here. Now I can like go from like chicken to like now buying steak. X number of times when I'm going to Chipotle. 
N
nathalie Ortega
48:09
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:10
Okay, that's super interesting. Okay. And do you feel this way about like other areas of spending? I'm gonna just pull an example to make it easier. But let's just say like shopping, right? Like not just food but like buying stuff. Like what? Let's pick an example. Where do you, where do you see yourself shopping? Like multiple times a month? 
N
nathalie Ortega
48:36
Again, Like the Old Navy Banana Republic company. That's where I usually shop. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:45
Okay, got it. So let's take Old Navy Banana Republic. What do you think you're going to be able to see looking at Like Old Navy Banana Republic spending, let's say from September till December, like every single transaction. Do you think you'll see there that is beyond what you would just see if you had Old Navy Banana Republic for just December? 
N
nathalie Ortega
49:11
I would definitely see less items purchasing for sure. Mostly going towards the clearance section, sales section. I would. Back then in September, I would never get a credit card from them, but the other week I did because I made a certain sale and I'm like, you know what? Okay, time for me to build more credit or time for me to get more deals out of being a loyal customer to these kind of brands. Plus they own multiple stores. I know. Well, I'm going to come back here and get some sort of discount using their credit card. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:51
Okay, got it. So basically you have a longer time frame to like be like, Let me just try to maybe make a metaphor about it. But it's like being able to see the entire movie versus like, okay, I got like a snippet of like one scene in the middle of it. You're like, okay, I can kind of understand like what I was doing across time and it helps me remember in general more. 
N
nathalie Ortega
50:16
Basically. Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:17
Okay, got it. Anything that feels like it's usually just a shorter time frame that you look at stuff where you're like, you know what? Like, I don't care what I did in November related to this at all. Just December is what's important. 
N
nathalie Ortega
50:39
The only thing I can say about November, just, I just got to travel more. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:45
Okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
50:45
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:47
Okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
50:47
Yeah, that's really it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:50
Got it, got it. So if I'm understanding that correctly, it's like if there was something that was just looked at from like a pure just single month perspective, travel in November because it's just very different than what I was doing in October or December. But for other things outside of travel, there's usually like, I guess few chapters of like what you are doing in other months that can help create a little bit more meaning or reflection around what you were doing in that specific kind of spend or that merchant. 
N
nathalie Ortega
51:26
I would need an example to think of one. That's what I'm trying to have trouble thinking. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:31
Yeah. Which is fine, by the way. I mean if, if things come to your mind more naturally, like, oh, I think of by Chipotle from September to December, that that's fine too. Right. If there's not something that comes to mind that has a cutoff of like only one month, then it probably just isn't right now that you're looking at which is also. 
J
Jeff Min
51:53
Okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
51:54
I will say my spending on bubble tea has been much more, less now. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:01
Okay. 
N
nathalie Ortega
52:02
Yes. I want to choose because since September, October, I was picking up more work. I was able to, like, you know, get it here and there. And in November, about a little too much. But now I'm like, all right, don't really need as much. That's kind of help down a lot. And that's one thing I will say for sure, that I haven't spending less on. Yeah. But otherwise, I can't think of anything else. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:33
Got it. Okay, that is super helpful. Over to you, Jeff. 
J
Jeff Min
52:41
I. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:41
Those are the main questions that had come up while were. 
J
Jeff Min
52:44
I just have. Last question. Could you scroll up perhaps one or two scrolls on this. On this page? Oh, maybe not this week. Let's go to another week with the. Yeah, anyone with the photo will do. Let's click on anything. Great. Okay, let's scroll down a little bit. All right, so in this screen, can you click on this mta, whatever. NYCD is probably the train. Let's say that it's. Is that what you were saying? Well, like, if you were able to see, I don't know, bubble tea shop, you know, there will be a merchant name, whatever, and then you'll see a bunch of transactions with the date. Is that. Is this similar to what you were saying? 
N
nathalie Ortega
53:35
Yes, because it gives me the picture, tells me the name. There's a title, at least with the picture. Yeah. And then that all these transactions, I know where they're coming from. Do I know what time they will happen? No, but I'm aware that I was spending on public transportation for all of these days. 
J
Jeff Min
53:54
Yeah. Would it be more helpful if you had the. What do you call it? The time? 
N
nathalie Ortega
54:02
Sure. Yeah, that always helps. I'll. I'll give an example. There's been times where I go out with my friends to a bar, and I don't know, it's like three in the morning. I. We end up at two, three different bars at night, and I'm like, oh, what was I getting at these bars? Oh, my God, how could I spend. Why did I spend this much on those kind of small things? Like, especially a time where you barely remember. Those will help. 
J
Jeff Min
54:29
Okay, got it. We could probably do something about it. Okay. That was my last question. Thank you so much. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:36
Yeah, same on my side. Natalie, just wanted to thank you so much for your time. This has been very helpful. So thank you for, you know, choosing to spend the time with us. 
N
nathalie Ortega
54:48
So how does it work with the gift card for this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:51
Yeah. So after this. So Yash is the point of contact. Who will be helping with that? So you'll get the full payment for the entirety of the research, which was the first conversation in this one. 
N
nathalie Ortega
55:04
And that's how much again, I. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:10
Have to check. I think it's. You know, let me get back to you to make sure it's the right number. I think I know it, but I just want to try to make sure it's correct. 
N
nathalie Ortega
55:18
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, sounds cool. All right. 
J
Jeff Min
55:24
All right. Thank you, Natalie. 
N
nathalie Ortega
55:26
Thank you. Have a good night. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:28
Bye. Bye.
