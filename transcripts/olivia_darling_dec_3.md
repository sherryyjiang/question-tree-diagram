How are you doing today? 
O
Olivia Darling
00:01
I'm doing pretty well. How are you doing? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:04
Well. Where are you dialing in from? 
O
Olivia Darling
00:06
I'm in. I'm from Maine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:09
Oh, okay. Got it. 
O
Olivia Darling
00:10
Okay, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:12
It must be very cold during this time of the year. 
O
Olivia Darling
00:15
No, yeah, it is. It's like one second. It's like. It's 17 degrees outside right now. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:20
Oh my goodness. 
O
Olivia Darling
00:21
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:21
That's below freezing, so that's pretty cold. 
O
Olivia Darling
00:24
Yeah, the low was 4 degrees today, so. Yeah, I. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:30
Did you grow up in Maine? 
O
Olivia Darling
00:32
Yeah, I did. I've lived in Maine. I lived in Maine till I. When I turned 20 and then after that I moved to California and I lived there for two years. But I'm back in Maine now, so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:42
Got it, got it. Did it go to school in California or. 
O
Olivia Darling
00:45
No, I went to college here. Here. And I actually graduated the same year I moved to California. I was like, me and my friend lived out there together and then we're both like. It's kind of hard being away from so far away from home. So then we moved back and I moved to Massachusetts after this. But. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:05
Yeah, yeah. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:06
Awesome. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:07
Well, thank you for, you know, getting on the call. I hope you can hear me. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:11
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:12
I'm just sticking a little bit quieter because it's. I'm actually in Asia right now, so it's like 5am in the morning, so I'm just trying to keep it down. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:21
Not. Yeah, no worries. I can hear you just fine. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:23
Oh, perfect. Well, I'll do a quick introduction on myself and then what we'll be doing during the call. So I'm Sherry and I'm doing research for Peak. We're basically chatting with people to understand some of the, I guess, decisions as well as challenges navigating like adulthood after graduating college, especially when it comes to money. So the purpose or the strategy structure of this call. First we'll just be getting to know a little bit more about you, asking general questions about like how post grad life has been, what you currently have as systems for managing money. And then the second half, I'll be sharing a couple of apps for you to just run through to just give feedback. Any questions on this so far? 
O
Olivia Darling
02:09
Okay, awesome. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:11
Well, I mean, we already kind of jumped into, you know, getting to know you a bit, but would love to just hear more, you know, what you studied, what you're doing now. 
O
Olivia Darling
02:23
Yeah. Okay. So in college I went to community college for two years and I studied human services. So like kind of like counseling or like you could go to social work. Stuff like that. I haven't done anything with my degree. I just got an associate's degree. I went for the two years. I graduated, and then I moved to California. I'm sorry, what was the other question? What I did in school? 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:50
Yeah, I mean, just however you want to answer it, actually, I wanted. What made you move to California? 
O
Olivia Darling
02:56
Actually. Okay. Actually, so that's a funny thing, is because I never really had plans for my life. Like, I don't really have a dream, like, career or, like, a dream like that. My friend, her dream has always been to move to California, like, her entire life, basically. And we had made, like, this, like, pact and, like, ooh, I want to say 2021. 2020? Yeah. It was probably 21, maybe 2020. And we're both, like, you know, it'd be, like, really fun to live together. But she'd been trying to move to California for a few years at this point, like, after she had graduated high school. But it was just, like, the timing was never right. She could never find a roommate, and, like, it was. So it was really hard for her. 
O
Olivia Darling
03:36
And so we're like, why don't we just move to California together in 2023? And so then that was the. That was the whole idea was just to, like, live together and just be in California, I guess. I don't know. It's, like, really different because we're both from a really small town, so, like, getting out of Maine, moving out of the state and. Yeah, so we moved there for two years. I liked it. It was warm. The weather was great. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:02
Which part of California were you in? 
O
Olivia Darling
04:05
We were, like, in the San Fernando Valley, so were kind of by Los Angeles, but we lived in, like, North Hollywood, Van Nuys Oaks area. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:13
I don't know. Yeah, I'm from California, which is why I asked. 
O
Olivia Darling
04:18
Yeah, yeah, no worries. Wait, do you live in, like, the Los Angeles area, or do you live in, like, other parts? 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:24
I live in Northern California, actually. So San Francisco Bay area. Yeah. 
O
Olivia Darling
04:29
Yeah. I never got the chance to travel up there. I mostly stayed really, in that Los Angeles area because I didn't have a car. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:36
Got it, got it. You got the better weather, I will admit. 
O
Olivia Darling
04:41
Oh, yeah, for sure. It was nice. Yeah. It's cold here. And I'm like, yeah, that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:48
That's awesome. So. So that was the first time that you lived, I guess, outside of your state then. 
O
Olivia Darling
04:54
Mm. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:55
What were some of the things that you learned that were, like, interesting, like, being so far away from, like, where you grew up? 
O
Olivia Darling
05:01
Oh, I mean, I learned how to take, like, the public transportation. I learned all about public transportation because here, where I live, or at least the area that I live in Maine, public transportation isn't really a thing. Like, if it is, I never really had to deal with it because it was like, if I don't have a mode of transportation, like, my own personal vehicle, then I wasn't going anywhere. So it was never something I really had to learn. So I learned a lot about public transportation. And, like, I also learned, I guess, more what it takes to live on your own. And just the idea of, like, things are really expensive, I guess, like, finding a place and, like, doing more stuff by myself, I guess, because, like, I live, like, when I hear I live at home. 
O
Olivia Darling
05:48
So it was like, I never. And I never didn't live at home when I lived in Maine. So moving to California was my first time living alone, even though I lived with my friend. It was like were equals rather than like, I'm someone's child, I guess, if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:04
What would you say were some of the challenges? You know, you said that things were a little bit expensive to get used to. 
O
Olivia Darling
06:11
Yeah, I mean, like, challenges. Like, I guess just like, figuring, like. Just literally figuring everything out and, like, being like, okay, she'll, like, rent a place. I need to do this. And, like, and if I am gonna move from one place, like, one apartment to the other, like, I still have to, like, pay for the current apartment while I find the other apartment. And also just, like, moving and, like, buying furniture. Yeah. Putting together, like, a bed and stuff like that. And like, also just, like, I don't know, like, figuring out just. And also learning street smarts. I guess that was kind of hardest first, like, to figure out, like, because I. We didn't have a car, like, basically the entire time we lived there. 
O
Olivia Darling
06:50
So, like, it was either were walking, were taking the bus, like, understanding the idea of stuff like that. Yeah, pretty much that. Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:05
And what would you say were, like, the things that you enjoyed the most, being out on your own? 
O
Olivia Darling
07:10
I mean, I guess I enjoyed, like, the independence of it all. Like, while it was really hard to do, it was also, like, kind of rewarding at the same time to be like, okay, look what I did. Like, I didn't need someone. I could do this by myself. Yeah. Like, I guess the whole idea of just being more independent with everything and then also, like, it was, like, also, like, getting a job, because I didn't really have a job while I was here. I had, like, small jobs. Like summer jobs. But then when I moved out there I got a job and I don't know, it's kind of rewarding to go to work and then being like make money and then like come home and be like, wow, just work today. I don't know. Something about it was like nice in a weird way. 
O
Olivia Darling
07:52
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:55
And how was it like, I guess like getting your first paycheck and then figuring out like what to do with it. 
O
Olivia Darling
08:01
Oh, it all went to rent. I was like, I can't do anything with this because like the first apartment that I had lived in, it was like someone's like guest house. And so it was furnished and it was like, it was furnished and like all of the like utilities were paid for in the rent, but it was extremely expensive. Like oh, I'd get my paychecks like because I just worked at Chipotle, so I wasn't really making that much but I was still money. But all of my paychecks would go straight to rent. Like I was like, sometimes I wouldn't make enough to pay rent. And so then I was like taking out of like my like because I had money before I moved to California because I knew I'd be money. 
O
Olivia Darling
08:40
So I've been saving but so I was just taking out of my money constantly. So that was really hard. But then like my pay increased because like in 2024 they increased like. What'S it called, like food service, like fast food workers wages. So that went up and so that helped a lot. But then it still didn't help that my rent was like really expensive. My half the rent was like nearly thirteen hundred dollars and I was living in a one bedroom and it was like. So yeah, that was really, it was like I was never really figuring what to do with my paycheck. So I was like, it's all going to rent. It was like really rewarding to get the money. But it was also like I can't do anything with money. So. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:33
Yes. Then I guess like how would you manage like things like outside of rent if it was like groceries or like other necessities. 
O
Olivia Darling
09:43
So for the. So like for like, for groceries. I was very fortunate. My parents actually knew that I wasn't making enough money and so they were paying for my groceries. Like we was just like a Walmart delivery. Like they just pay for it because I, if I had to pay for groceries, I, I don't know, I would have just really struggled. I probably wouldn't have got very much food if I did get groceries. Like I would have been like, oh, I'm gone. Like, I'm not getting much this week. And so, like, it was like, so I was fortunate enough for my parents paid for my groceries and then, like, all the other expenses. It was just like, I have a weird mindset with money where it's like, I know that I'll be okay with it, like, if I spend something. 
O
Olivia Darling
10:25
Like, because I knew, like, my. Like, I wasn't. Like, if I had paid rent, and I knew I was like, okay, well, I don't. I spent all my paycheck on rent. Even if I bought something that wasn't, like. Like, that was whatever. I never felt bad or tried to shame myself, like, oh, I have to, like, do better. Because I was just. I have this mindset that I'm going to be fine. And I guess maybe the idea of, like, with my parents were paying for my groceries or as I kind of, like, I knew if I really needed it, I could always be like, hey, so, yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:58
And I mean, you said something interesting earlier that, like, what does it like to hear more about? Because you said your friend, like, had this, like, dream of moving to California, but you're like, oh, I don't really have a dream in life, but I'm sure there's something that you enjoy, right? 
O
Olivia Darling
11:13
I mean, here's the thing. I've always had this problem, like, where I'm like, because I enjoy. So, like, I went to Human Services because I was like, okay, we're gonna, like, help people. And so, like, that was the idea for Human Services. And, like, the ide kind of while I was in college was maybe, like, being, like, a elementary school counselor, because that idea interested me. But then I worked at an elementary school as an internship, and I was working, like, in, like, the special ed department because that's where my friend's mom worked, so I could get an in there. And so I was like, okay, like, let me see. Like, what? This is kind of like elementary school life. And I knew I'd be working with a lot of the kids that are in special ed. 
O
Olivia Darling
11:48
Because it's not necessarily just like, special ed. These are kids also, like, with. It's not like. I don't know, it's like, almost like, mental health problems as well. And, like, just. They have, like, really harsh home lives. Home lives. Lives. And so then it's like they're in special ed. Not necessarily because, like, they are. They have, like, learning disorders, but more that it's harder for them to focus in such a big classroom. Environment. And so they need more one one help and stuff like that. But then I learned I didn't want to be an elementary school counselor. And so I was like, oh. And so like, I've always struggled with the idea of like, what do I want to do when I grow up? Like, I've never really had a, a solid idea. 
O
Olivia Darling
12:31
Even now I still like the idea of helping people really, like, is something that kind of motivates me and like, I want to do something with that. But at the same time I'm also like, I could just like volunteer as a hobby. Like, I don't need to make it my full career. And so like, I'm still like lost in that space because I don't really have a dream necessarily. Like right now I'm kind of like, maybe I should do something with cooking. I don't know. Like, I have a very, like, I feel like I just haven't found something that really like. Inspires me. Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:08
I mean, that's okay. I mean, I think people like decades older are still figuring it out as well. I think that's part of it. But at least it's good to know like, the things you enjoy. And it doesn't always have to be a job, you know, it could just be something you do with your time that you really like. 
O
Olivia Darling
13:27
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:29
And you mentioned something like also earlier that you wanted to move to Massachusetts. Tell me more about that. 
O
Olivia Darling
13:39
Okay, so this one's a bit weirder. So it was like initially, so my. So my friend had gone home. So she came back. So were in California in August, and in August she had went home for like a month. And then when she came back to me, she was like, basically like, I can't do this anymore. I can't live in California anymore. I don't want to live in California anymore. It's draining me. And she's the friend that wanted to live there, but it just. When she had moved there, it wasn't what she had wanted. It wasn't like the environment for her to grow in that she thought it would be. And so then for me, I was staying out there mostly for her. 
O
Olivia Darling
14:16
But then it was also like this sort of like thing of like why I'm out here now and I'm like being my own self. So it's like kind of nice. And so then she was like, I basically can't do it anymore. I'm moving. I'm moving out of California. And I'm like, okay, cool, like for sure, like, I'll Come with you. Like, I'm like, I was kind of staying there for her, and so then she was moving out. So it was like, it's weird if I stay. And so then she was like, okay, but I don't know, because she didn't want to necessarily. We didn't want to move back here. And she's like, I kind of want to live somewhere different, but I want to live closer to home. That way we can travel within the day to get home. 
O
Olivia Darling
14:54
And also, like, but we're not at home, so it's not like we're home. So we still have space from family and stuff, but we're not like, we don't have to take three planes to get home. And so then Massachusetts was mostly brought up because of, like, the different aspects that she had wanted in, like, living situation. I think personally for me, I think I could live most anywhere, honestly, after living in California compared to like Maine. To me, it was like, I think I can live anywhere. Like, it was like, I was like, I enjoyed California for what it had. Like, sure was like, it was like, what got me the most was the fact that it's far away from home. And so I think I would enjoy someplace closer to home. But it's like, I mean, I survived. 
O
Olivia Darling
15:40
I was alive, I was living. I like, I gained friends there. Like, I had a community at my work. And so, yeah, Massachusetts, it was mostly her idea. But then I kind of just went along with it because I was like, you know, Massachusetts is close. It's kind of like it's close to home. Like, I know I could live there and it just seems like a nice place. I don't know. It's like, I don't know. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:05
Yeah. That'S. That's awesome. And I guess in between, right, like, you moved home and like, how has that been, like, going from living on your own to like back at home with parents? 
O
Olivia Darling
16:20
Yeah, no, that's. It's weird. It's like, I feel. I feel honestly really stuck here in Maine because, like, it's like I'm in a weird in between situation, I guess, where it's like, I'm not like, I'm living here, but like, I'm moving. I'm hoping to move out soon. But then I'm also like, it's weird because now it's like, it's just weird, like constantly having someone, it's like me and my parents aren't equal necessarily because they're my parents. And so it's not the same living situation. And I'm not currently. I don't currently have a job because I was. I was hoping to get a mo. This is like a whole other tangent, but I was trying to get a remote job. 
O
Olivia Darling
17:00
That way, moving to Massachusetts would be easier because then it's like, well, I don't have to, like, pick up my work and, like, try and find a job there. But then now I'm trying to be like, well, I probably should find a job here, even if it's like, something small, like locally or whatever. That way I'm making money. And so now I'm like. Then it's also like, while I'm here, I don't. I didn't go out much in California either. But, like, I. I rarely leave the house now. And so I'm just, like, constantly home. And that's, like, also a weird thing for me. And so it's like, I feel a lot like, well, it's really nice being home, especially for the holidays. It's still like. It feels like I feel really stuck here. And it's not necessarily my parents. 
O
Olivia Darling
17:43
It's like, almost like my own state of being. Like, I'm moving, but I'm not moving yet because I don't have a job. And so then I can't move, but then it's like, I don't know. So. Yeah, so it's a weird state of I'm stuck. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:58
Yeah, no, for sure. I totally understand. Like, it's. Yeah. I mean, I think you'll figure it out. It just takes a little bit of time. 
O
Olivia Darling
18:08
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:10
And I mean, I have to ask because, you know, obviously this is about money, but how does it work right now? Like, when. When you're home, like, does. Do you have, like. If you want to get something for your own, is that coming out of, like, your money, or do you have, like, an allowance with your parents and you budget that way? Like, what's that process? 
O
Olivia Darling
18:31
I mean, it's mostly like, if I want something, like, for me, I also feel a lot of guilt when I make my parents buy stuff or get. My parents get stuff for me. And so then it's like this weird, like, oh, I probably shouldn't ask them for stuff. Especially when my dad had driven out to California in his van and picked me and my friend up, packed all our stuff inside his van and drove us back to Maine. So then there's like, oh, he spent all this money to come get me. And then, like, I've always kind of felt like, especially now that I'm an adult, it feels More like, I should be almost providing for myself. And so then it's like, mostly it comes out of my. Like, if I want something, I buy it, like, occasionally. Like. 
O
Olivia Darling
19:13
Like, if they go, like, they. I don't get a weekly allowance or a monthly allowance from them or anything. If, when they go grocery shopping, they'll ask, want anything, like, to add to the food. And most of the time. And, like, I'll get stuff but that I know they'll eat as well. That makes sense. Like, if they want, like, I'll say, like, I'll get a bag of apples or, like, a bag of oranges. Where it's not like, oh, I'm just gonna be eating this. Like, everyone's gonna be eating it. But yeah, it's mostly like, if I want something, I will. I'll just buy myself. Because again, that guilt thing. But yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:45
Yeah, no, for sure. And, like, if you think about, like, your, I guess, favorite things to spend on, like, what would come to mind? 
O
Olivia Darling
19:55
My favorite things. Ooh, okay. I really. Most of the time, what I'm buying is food. I guess my favorite thing to spend money on is just food. It's just like. I guess it's almost like I feel rewarded when I buy it because it's like I'm getting something from what I'm purchasing because it's not like a thing of, like, oh, I'm not getting anything. Like, oh, I'm being fed. So then that makes me feel good when I buy it. And honestly, the other thing I'd say is probably just buying other people's stuff, which is weird. But I guess that's like, kind of like one of the things I like to do is I like to buy people stuff because I don't know, I just do. And so, like, I'll. Because, like, I don't feel as much. Like, I don't necessarily feel bad about spending money. 
O
Olivia Darling
20:40
And so whenever I do spend money, if I'm buying it for someone else, that also feels nice because I don't know. So, yeah. So my guess, my things are food and. Fine. Just other people's food mostly, I'd say. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:52
But yeah. So for food, is it like. Like, I guess, snacks for yourself or is it, like, going out to eat or, like, mixture of all of them? 
O
Olivia Darling
21:03
It's not really going out to eat. It's mostly like snacks or, like. No, it's honestly snacks. And truthfully, it's snacks. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:11
What's your favorite snack or favorite. 
O
Olivia Darling
21:14
I just love chips. I'll just get a bag of chips and I'm just like, that's good. That's really good. Like, And I know I should be smarter with it. Like, I should be buying, like, things I can make meals with, but I don't. I just, like. Because then I'll see stuff and be like, I can make that. And then I just don't. And I'm like, probably should have, but no, yeah, I just might. Because if I get a big bag of chips, I'm like, wow, I can have so many snacks. Yeah, yeah, I just get some chips. Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:44
And then what were some of the things that you remember, like, buying for other people, like, in recent memory? 
O
Olivia Darling
21:50
Well, recently it was my friend's birthday, so she had, like. So I normally ask her what she wants for her birthday, and she'll send me stuff. And then I try and think of, like, other things to buy for her, because that way she's just getting more than, like, what, like, she's eating, like, surprise gifts. And so then I got her, like, sweatpants and like, a. Like, a hand warmer where it's, like, electric, so you can, like, heat up her hands, like, immediately because she gets really cold really quickly. So I was, like, smart then. So then that's what I bought. And then, like, recently I went to, like, Dunkin Donuts, and then I got my mom Donuts while I was there. And, like, I got her those. And she tried to. 
O
Olivia Darling
22:29
She gave me money for them, but then I gave her back the money because I felt bad because they're like, nah, you buy me, like, groceries every week and stuff. It's fine. So then. And so that's also another thing I find is, like, if my parents will, like, buy me groceries, if they, like, ask me to do something or, like, buy them something, I'm like, okay, I'll just do it. Because it's like, you're already giving to me anyway. But, yeah. And then, of course, Christmas is coming up, so I'll be, like, buying gifts for people and stuff like that. I haven't bought any Christmas gifts yet, actually. Fun fact. I'm. Me and my family are really late on it this year. We're going on the 20th to do all our Christmas shopping. So good luck. Good luck with that. I know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:12
That's okay. I mean, do you know what you're, like, getting for some people yet? Or that's still, like, being worked out? 
O

I have no idea. Like, I think I'm. I have no idea what I'm getting my sister. I've. Maybe I'll get my mom. Like, I Have no idea. Like, honestly, we all go together as well. So then we all just like, be like, oh, I want this. Someone will be like, buy it. Okay. And then my sister were like, I'll get that. Or she'll be like, oh, I'll get that. And so then we. That way we all go together. We can just be like, we can find stuff and be like, you can give me that. And sometimes it's better that way because then it's like, okay, we're getting the person something that they. We know the like, yeah, that makes sense. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:54
That makes sense versus, like, you know, you buy a gift and someone has. 
O
Olivia Darling
23:57
To politely be like, oh, thank you. So nice. Yeah, yeah. Because then they can open. Be like, yes. I've been waiting to open this. I've been wanting those now, so. Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:09
Now, how about something that you, like. Don'T enjoy spending money on or you felt guilty or regret. Regretful spending on it. 
O
Olivia Darling
24:20
Honestly, Gas, I hate. So I have a car now. Like, we bought a car, and I hate spending money on gas. I'm like, why is this. Why am I doing, like, why do I have to buy gas? Like, this is too much. I don't want to do this. Also, like, because I have a car now. We have to pay insurance. And when I look at my insurance, I'm just like, what is this? Why I don't want to pay for this? I think it's also the amount that I'm spending on it that it's, like, makes me annoyed that I'm like, I don't want to buy this. But it's also like a thing of where I have to buy money. I have to pay for gas, I have to pay for my insurance. 
O
Olivia Darling
24:51
So it gets us more things that necessarily, like, I, like, I actually need that I'm, like, annoyed by. I'm like, great, I have to buy this. Whereas things where I'm like, I don't necessarily have to buy. I'm like, oh, what a treat. So I just. I don't know what. I don't know what that's about. Yeah, I'd say more things just like, necessary, like gas and my insurance. I hate spending money on them. I don't know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:15
Yeah, that's super interesting because I think when I talk to people, like, some people say they really don't like to pay for parking. And I was thinking, like, but you have to park, right? But it's like they're like the daily. Maybe like the daily frictions or like, they don't really Bring you joy, but you just need to spend on it that, like, maybe you don't enjoy as much. 
O
Olivia Darling
25:35
No. Yeah, for sure. And, like, good thing about Maine is you don't you. Like, I never have to pay for parking here. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:41
Oh, wow. 
O
Olivia Darling
25:42
Okay. Parking lots. And so, like, I'm never paying for parking, so. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:47
Is there a lot of space in Maine or, like, it's just. Okay, yeah, there's, like. 
O
Olivia Darling
25:52
I. Like, in Maine, there's street parking, but personally, I've, like, never parked on a street. Like, I've parked maybe once when I was, like, in the bigger city. But, like, there's not really street parking. Like, in California, where it's like, that's all there is. Sometimes it's just that street and you're like, parking. No, I. That is not how Maine is. It's like, everyone, like, places have parking lots. People have driveways. You just park in. You shouldn't. But, like, sometimes, like, events, like, there's a fair, like, most people will, like, rent out their, like, yards for people to park in. Oh, wow. Okay. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:30
That is such a foreign concept to me because parking is such a scarce thing in California. 
O
Olivia Darling
26:37
Oh, my God. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:41
Yeah. So I'm like, oh, my gosh. That's music to my ears to hear that. What are. I'm wondering if there's other things that you bought or, like, you're like, oh, I don't know if I loved it maybe in, like, the area of, like, shopping or. 
O
Olivia Darling
26:57
Yeah. I'm trying to think. Because most of the time, if I. I mean, I've definitely bought in clothes where I'm like, why did I buy this? Like, I'm, like, wearing it now. I'm like, oh, I'm never gonna wear this again. So I guess for me, it's mostly clothes. So, like, not necessarily. I can't. Like, mostly if I do online shopping. If I do online shopping, disaster. I won't. Like, it's like, either it doesn't fit right, or I'm like, what was I thinking when I bought this? Like, why did I think this was a good choice? Like, I have some pieces that, like, I decided, like, hey, I need some, like, different kinds of shirts that aren't just T shirts. But I'm like, I never wear those shirts. And I'm like, why did I do that? So it's mostly, I think, clothes. 
O
Olivia Darling
27:49
So I guess sometimes, like, I'll buy, like, skin care and. Because, like, my skin is, like, really dry, so I have to try and find, like, a moisturizer that moisturizes my skin, but it never works. I don't know, my skin is just like, it's like almost like weirdly dry. But even if it feels moisturized, it's still like flaking. I don't know, that's another issue. But so like, I guess sometimes I'll find products that I think will work for me and they don't. And so then that's kind of frustrating. But I try not to buy clothes or like beauty products that often only because, like, I mostly like the only time I really do. And if I do, it's mostly, I'd say I, I ask more for like clothes and stuff like that, I guess rather than like me buying it myself. 
O
Olivia Darling
28:41
Because then I also, when I do that, I do more in person stuff. So I know I'm going to like it or I know I'm going to wear it because I've tried it on, I know it fits me. And it's mostly like, for me it's mostly buying like pants. I'll be like, hey, can you get me some pants? I really need pants. But like, so. Because that's what I got. That's what I asked for last Christmas was just a bunch of jeans because I was like, I don't have enough. Other than that. So for me, like my expense, like stuff that it's mostly clothes. That I buy online and then like products that I think will work for me but don't. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:17
And where were you buying stuff online? 
O
Olivia Darling
29:21
Mostly like bad places like Temu. That was mostly it because then it was like cheap. So like, then I didn't feel as bad, but then it was like, it's like not that great. And then I'm trying to think of other places. That was mostly it because I just bought clothes from Tina and then I was like. These weren't. I don't wear these clothes ever. So. Yeah, yeah. Got it, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:52
I was going to say for dry. I have dry skin too. I don't know if I've tried like Ceramides before, but they kind of work. Or like, or Korean skin care, but I think everyone's skin is different. But yeah, it's. It's tough. 
O
Olivia Darling
30:07
Yeah, it is. It's really tough. And I'm like, I don't never know what to use because I don't want to make my skin oily. But I don't know. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:17
And then, let me see. So currently, like, I guess to track like spending and everything. Are you checking your banking app, like frequently or how are you doing it? 
O
Olivia Darling
30:32
Yeah, I just Mostly check my banking apps because I, I have. I think I only did one on the peak app, but I have two credit cards that I use but I. And I always pay them off. I don't like, I use them like a debit card I guess where I know I'm gonna have to like pay it off eventually, like at the end of the month or whatever. So I never like, I never spend like too much on a credit card or whatever. But yeah, that's why I check my spending is. I mostly like will go on my bank app and I'll just check like what I've bought in or like stuff like that. But I don't really track my spending as much currently because I am not. Because I'm not really getting much cash inflow right now. 
O
Olivia Darling
31:11
And then I'm also not buying as much right now. Like I will be with the holidays but so I try not to look at it too much because I'm like, I don't know, look. But other than that, yeah, it's just mostly looking on my like Apple. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:27
Gotcha. 
O
Olivia Darling
31:27
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:28
Okay, well, thank you for answering all the questions. We're going to move on to like going through a, an app experience. So this is actually separate from the peak app. I'm going to send you a link to open up. Hold one second. 
O
Olivia Darling
31:52
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:52

Oh yes, I do. Sorry, I was on mute. Yeah, so once you're like able to get a statement, all you just have to do is upload it. This doesn't get saved in our system, so don't worry about it. 
O
Olivia Darling
34:17
Okay. I think I, I think my file is selected. Do I just continue? Yeah, it's like here. Like I can't scroll for some reason.

Here's. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:42
It'll take, like, a minute or so to process. So in the meantime, I'll just give you some instruction here. Just kind of pretend that I'm not here and just, like, interact with it, like, as if you were just using it. The thing I'll ask is if you could just, like, pretend that there's, like, this microphone to your head and you're just, like, voicing your thoughts out loud, which I think you're already pretty good at. 
O
Olivia Darling
35:02
So that's fine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:03
You can say things like, oh, this looks interesting. Oh, what is this? 
O
Olivia Darling
35:08
This is cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:09
I don't really like this. Or I don't understand this. Like, things like that. Just whatever comes to mind. And I'll. I'll try to, like, generally stay quiet. But if you do have questions on things, I can. I can jump in. 
O
Olivia Darling
35:21
Okay. Oh. Oh, okay. I was so confused at first. I was like, what am I doing? Wait. I do this drag. Like, dragging. Drag and drop. Okay, that's fine, I guess. Okay. I have no idea. Probably. Stocking up. Oh, so many questions. I don't remember. The 27th, though. Moving sex. Yes. And the 30th. I bought my friend chicken tenders. How do I say that? Review or just adjust ratings. I don't know what to say about that one. The 23rd. Amazon. I have no idea what it. Is. What would I buy off Amazon? The 23rd? I have no idea. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:34
Talk about. 
O
Olivia Darling
38:37
Indulgent moment. You feel indulgent. Best. Yeah, it was. Oh, I see now. Okay, I get it. Yes. Yes, I see now. I don't remember. Okay, okay. Makes more sense. Checking for my friend. Yes. Yes. I guess we'll do. Just needed a bite. Yes. Yes, yes. I don't remember what I bought off Amazon, but. It was. The 23rd, so I haven't moved yet. There's probably something for the move, so. Okay. Interesting. Oh, my goodness. Right? Oh, interesting. It'll tell me my values and how I'm actually spending my money. It's cool. Okay. That's fun. Okay. Okay. Liking that. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I do need to think about where my spending. Okay. I have more days that I can look at. No. Okay, cool. 8. 22. Spending. Yes. Okay. Oh, my goodness. Quick reflection. Pumps. Okay. Money. Store. Chips. Because. I want. Wow. Okay. Cool. 
O
Olivia Darling
43:39
Bike of chips. Joy. Truly. Oh, okay. Okay. I see what this means. Oh, okay. Spent money. My friend's. Birthday. Got her. Yes. Birthday. Which holds value. Yes. Yes, it does. Connection. Wait. Oh, that's interesting. Looking at like how much money I'm actually spending on like connection and growth compared to each other. Trying to like the transactions connection. I think if one thing might spend money growth. The more data points were collected. Price tag. A birthday gift. Was like the first one was like $44. Okay. Okay. Breakdown, tension. Number. Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. Cece. Oh. I guess I don't buy many growth related things, but I. Growth. Growth. No, I don't. What else did I do? I haven't done any like growth things. I. I. What else have I done for my spending? Oh, I, I. A. Action. Yeah. Yes. 
O
Olivia Darling
46:58
It does seem like that I am spending money on relationships. More computer driver. I see. I see. Wanted to learn. Security, insurance, savings. I spent hundred dollars on car insuring this. Yeah. Oh yes. Security. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:37
Yes. Yes. 
O
Olivia Darling
47:38
I guess it is security for sure. Now with security or insurance. Yeah. It is a necessity but I don't love doing it. Stages. Budget. I will. I wonder. I will definitely go Connection. Yes. Setting side. My fourth. Smart. Smart. Okay. Don't have a particular spending. Budget, but I probably should make one. Okay, cool, cool. Now they're the basics. Right. So nothing. So I'm not making any money. Okay. Insurance. Yes. Plug in what you know. Example, monthly net income. Six essentials. Disposal income equals. Okay. Five slices. My goodness. Right. Factoring the upcoming Christmas gifts. Oh. Okay. I see what you mean now that makes sense. This just makes a lot of sense. Tell me your actual moving or a ballpark. I don't have a month income. Any fixed cost. Somewhat generic. Let's get those basics down. I don't have a net income. Net income. 
O
Olivia Darling
51:23
Fixed. There. Fixed. Income. Oh, not fixed income. Fixed costs. 100 and. I'm not sure. Budget. Okay. Yes. Budgeting with zero steady income. Yep. Okay. Write down the most realistic number you think you can bring this. That's even 200 changes picture thematically perfect. Okay. Security versus 100. True. Example with Right. Okay. Okay. True. Good idea. Good idea. Quick actions you can take now. Okay, okay. I see what you mean here. Smart. I like this plan. I like it. Do you have any side hustles already. The next few weeks? Real dollars. Side. Of. Like 1:85. Or just. Oh my gosh, just December. So December cash flow. I feel like I'm starting in a flow state with this. I'm like, I'm really like, I feel like I'm really getting some knowledge right now. Like I feel like I'm actually learning something about my finances right now. 
O
Olivia Darling
53:54
Okay. $85. I might confit. Oh, okay. 35. 15, 25. Emergency buffer. Okay. Security. True. X. Okay. Yeah. Stay in the $25 spot. Okay. I like these ideas though. Those are cute. Oh, okay. Steps. Pay. Yes, I already paid that. Who shows? You can. Oh, you can track purchases. H. What if I need more money for. Gifts? Okay. Option one, adding 15 from growth. Right? Yes. Okay. Originally. Okay. Smart. Makes sense. Okay, thank you. Okay. Security can't go negative, so you could pretend from it. Okay. Any buffer. More gifts. Higher connection. Shares. True. Less growth. Slower building, slower skill building. True, True, true. How many gifts do you really need? Interesting. Interesting thought. Am I okay with cutting growth? I mean, I'm not spending on anything. Anything anyway. So you need to turn 5 for either growth or joy. Maybe. Yes. 
O
Olivia Darling
56:20
Yeah, that looks cool. Okay, we'll adjust the catholic categories. Per minute lock and a concrete split. So what if I want. To do. I want to do 50. I'm going to do 50 for gifts. Okay. Oh. Oh, that's cool. Where I can shift the money from other places to continue to keep that buffer. Okay. Okay. Dominates growth. Confirm split. What if I want to not spend money and grow? Oh. I don't know if I said that right. No growth. You have 85 activities. I don't want any growth money. Action stays. Joy. Hobby. Security. It's only five. Couple of coffee. See for budget. Okay. Connection. $10 for security. Makes sense. Right? I mean, I don't really buy paid courses, so I probably have to change. Yes. And then. Under. I change. And. I change. My ranked. Oh, it tells me how to do it. 
O
Olivia Darling
58:46
Okay, perfect. Open the values tabs in the app. The app. Okay. Yes. Your app store is ranking. So change it. Just three simple things. Okay. How to change ranking? Open the values app. Yeah. Tap the edit icon. Pencil. Drag items up or down. Hit save. Okay. I like this. This was very helpful. Okay. Okay. So yeah, I want to do connection first. That's number one. I'll do joy. Number. Two. And. Security. Is three and rows. Yes. Okay. $2, right? Yes. Makes sense. Makes this makes a lot of sense. What it's telling me. And yes. Zero. Zero for this month. If you keep the gift full gift budget try gets a solid treat fund. Yes. True. I feel like. Yes. Okay. $5. I don't know. Now we go thin line. It probably won't. Growth can stay zero. Yes. Option one. Okay. That was fun. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:01:09
That was easy too. That was really easy actually to do. That was really easy if you earn more. Okay. I can. Yeah, I can redo it. Oh, my gosh. Oh, that was so easy. Okay. Okay. Okay. What else Should I do here? Can I do that? My gosh. Maybe I'll do connection. Joy security. Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. That was pretty sea gol. Okay, I liked that. I liked that. Spending what doesn't match how you see yourself. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. What if. Okay. I see. What if I. I want to start. Action. Buy coffee, rent new movie, game transfer. Okay. The next two weeks. After two weeks, you'll have at least. Okay. Oh, okay. Set a site. Wrinkle Joy addict dream with joy. Oh, okay. I like that. That's fun. This is so easy to read. It's so readable. Okay. Upcoming purchases. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:03:23
Merchant amount in they. I have no idea what I'm gonna be spending on coming up. Tag them. Next. Do I have to pay this one? No, I don't shoot my coffee groceries. Label. I don't know. I'll probably buy chips though this week or next week. So probably I'll buy them from Walmart. Chips. How much will it be? $5. And it will be on probably. Is. It is. 13Th. Will be December. Connection. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, so easy. So simple. Was chips for me. Personal scent, crossfit joy. $5. Ben. Okay. Oh. I like. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. I like what I'm seeing. This is so easy to read. I really like that. Like that about this one. What else can I do? What else can I do? Depending on what matters. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:05:57
Do I use these panic spitty things or should I shift my swing name? Let's go to the spin then. Can I not? What's happening? I just might be my laptop. Oops. Yes. Okay. It's just my laptop. No, it's probably my Internet. I guess I don't want to look at that one. I guess I don't want to look at any of them because we'll make connection. I don't know if I should page. Probably should. Yes. It's happening. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:07:31
Hey, Olivia. Yeah, probably something is timing out in the app, so don't worry about it. I just also realized we're actually a couple of minutes over the hour. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:07:42
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:07:44
Do you have a couple more minutes to, like, answer questions? I already appreciate the time. Yeah. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:07:50
Okay. Do you want to stop sharing my screen? Yeah, sure. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:07:57
I think that's okay. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:08:01
Because I was like, there's not really anything going on there anyway. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:08:04
Yeah, all good. I'll ask a couple questions. But yeah. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:08:09
What did you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:08:09
How did you feel about the. I guess overall app and exercise? 
O
Olivia Darling
01:08:14
I really liked it, honestly. It was very, like, informative. I guess, like, it was really easy to use. Like if, like I was Never really, like, when he was like, showing me the breakdowns and stuff. I was never confused, like, what's happening? Like, it was like, hard to read or like, this is too much like, almost like finance language or anything where it was, like, trying to say stuff that I couldn't understand. So I really liked that I could read it and I could understand what it was saying to me because I feel like with some finance apps, like, I've used one before, and it was almost like it was a lot of, like, technical term or whatnot. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:08:44
And I was, like, confused and like, also this one had like, really good step by step, like, and it gave me, like, examples of like, for like, gifts one. Like, it was like telling you, like, oh, you can make like a handmade card or you could do this where it'd be in this budget. And I thought that was really helpful that way. I'm like, what could I use spend on this much money? And it just, like, gave me options. So I really appreciated that. But it was really easy to use as well. Like, I could ask questions and it was like, even, like, about the app itself. It was telling me how to do it, like, where I was like, how do I change, like, my values? 
O
Olivia Darling
01:09:17
And even though, like, I wasn't necessarily talking about that, it, like, switched over and was able to help me with that. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:09:27
And what were some things you think you learned when you were going through it? 
O
Olivia Darling
01:09:33
Honestly, I don't. I feel like it like, really helped me, like, it just kind of helped me, like, really see my, like, spending. Or like, I was like, I was saying, like, I don't really have a income necessary, but I was like, putting my side hustles and then being like, okay, I have like a hundred dollars that I pay for my insurance. And so I guess it just showed me, like, it also showed me how easy it can be. I guess, like, it can be easy to track your finances, it can be easy to budget. Like, it doesn't have to be complicated. Yeah. And then. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:10:10
Trying to remember my notes. I think earlier you. You had a reaction when the chat came out. I think you were like, oh, my goodness. I don't know if you remember, but, like, what was going through your head? 
O
Olivia Darling
01:10:25
I don't remember, but I probably was thinking, like, either, like, this is a lot of information in the sense of like, they really, like, broke it down and they like, really gave this to me because I feel like that was like, really surprising to me. Like, it wasn't just like a Short thing. Because I know normally with, like, either, like, with AI responses, it can be pretty short sometimes where it's not very detailed. But this one was really detailed, and, like, it broke everything down. And it was, like, it gave me, like, questions that I could answer or, like, I don't know, you see a lot of information, but it was never overwhelming, I guess. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:10:55
So that's the reaction. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:10:56
Like, okay, this is a lot, like, in a good way. 
S

Okay, gotcha. Makes sense. And, oh, you've mentioned earlier that you've tried, like, other finance apps that you felt like, were, like, confusing or harder to use. Like, do you remember which one you've tried? 
O
Olivia Darling
01:11:15
I mean, I was, like, using Nerd Wallet for a moment, but Nerdwall, it was just confusing me. It was just like, there was, like, so many buttons. There were so many things to do, but, like, I didn't really understand it. But I used Nerd Wallet, like, for a minute, and I, like, I just didn't care for it. I was like, I never wanted to go on to it. I was like, I don't. I don't want to look at it. Whereas this. This feels so much, like, easier and almost like it feels friendlier. That makes sense. Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:11:46
Okay, let's see. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:11:50
And how did you feel? 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:11:52
Like, I noticed you transitioned from, like, learning and asking questions to, like, doing, like, starting to get into budgets and stuff. Like, yeah. Like, how did that whole process make you feel? 
O
Olivia Darling
01:12:06
Honestly, good. Like, I was like, oh, like, this app is, like, helping me. And it made me feel, like, almost like, secure, I guess you could say. Like, I was like. I was, like, looking at the app, and then I was like, you know, like, okay, like, I, like, try and, like, do a thing where I go budget. But it just got, like, really helpful for me when I was like, I think where I felt helped, actually. And then, like, it was, like, helped me, like, clear my thoughts about, like, okay, like, I have this much money, and, like, I can, like, spend it on this and I can spend it this way, I guess, because I hadn't been thinking like that, so I don't know, I just, like, just turned into something really helpful. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:12:43
So do you feel like, in a way, like, asked a series of questions that was able to, like, I guess bring things out that were already in your head and just, like, put them out on a piece of paper? 
O
Olivia Darling
01:12:53
Pretty much, yeah. Because I was thinking about, like, how am I gonna split this up? And then it was like, okay, well, like, it was almost like, first step. Like, what's this. What's this information? And then I was like, okay. And then it was, like, breaking it down for me. Yeah. So it's really helpful. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:13:07
Okay, so you liked it how it was. It took something that maybe felt more complicated and long and, like, broke it down step by step where it made it feel easy. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:13:16
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:13:21
And I noticed that there are a couple things that you had a harder time remembering, which is totally normal. Do you know roughly, like, how far back you usually remember, like, spending things or, like, doing things? Because I think the one that you didn't remember was, like, October 27th. So that was obviously, like, a month ago. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:13:42
Yeah. Yeah. I. I mean, I normally will remember it. Because I don't. I think. I wouldn't say I spend that frequently. And if I do, it's normally a purchase of, like, that I'm intentionally making, I guess. And so I'll make it. So I'm like, I'm buying it from for a reason. And then, like, sometimes I know I would buy stuff, but it was like. It was like, because I needed it in the moment. Oh, I remember what it was. That thing that I couldn't remember. I remember what it was. It was. It was for my car. I was. I just had to think about it. I had to buy something for my car. So, yeah, I remember. I would say I remember most of my purchases, like, for over a month. So I. I think I remember. So you have it. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:14:27
I just have to think about it for a second. Why would you be spending money? And then I can be like, oh, that's what I was spending money. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:14:33
Gotcha. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:14:34
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:14:37
And then in the beginning, when there were, like, a bunch of values, right? There was, like, growth, connection, etc, did you feel like you had an understanding of what those were or you grew to understand what they were more as you were, like, chatting with the AI? 
O
Olivia Darling
01:14:52
Honestly, I feel like I understood. I thought I understood them when I first read them, but then when chatting with the AI, they became more, like. I understood them better. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:15:16
I think that's probably all the questions that I have. Olivia, thank you so much for your time. And we'll reach out for, like, the next part of this as well. I know that it's Christmas holiday, so I know it's. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:15:34
It's. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:15:35
It's almost Christmas holiday. Oh, it's only December 10th. Oh, my gosh. I don't know why I thought it was December 20th. Okay, we'll figure out a time for the next chapter. Just wanted to thank you so much for your time and, like, being so, like, open and, you know, vulnerable and sharing. 
O
Olivia Darling
01:15:49
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. It was fun. I enjoyed it. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:15:54
Awesome.
