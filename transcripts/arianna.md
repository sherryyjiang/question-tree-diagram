Arianna Santiago: 00:00 
 Hello.

Sherry Jiang: 00:03 
 Hi. Ariana.

Arianna Santiago: 00:04 
 Hi, how are you?

Sherry Jiang: 00:06 
 Hi, I'm good. Nice to meet you.

Arianna Santiago: 00:08 
 Nice to meet you too. Awesome.

Sherry Jiang: 00:11 
 Well, I'll, I guess quickly like introduce myself and then would love to like get into it and get to know you more. So I'm Sherry, I'm doing research for Peak and we're talking to people about some of their adult decisions, especially around things like money to help with a product that we are building. And this call will be divided into two parts. The first one we just spend getting to know you a little bit, how you think about, I guess, money in your life. And then second part we'll be running through a couple of app experiences to get your feedback.

Arianna Santiago: 00:49 
 Awesome. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 00:50 
 Any questions before we get started?

Arianna Santiago: 00:53 
 Just one question. I'm on a walk right now. Is that okay or do I. I'm totally like, I can find a bench and like sit down if that would be better for the purposes of the call.

Sherry Jiang: 01:00 
 But yeah, for the first part of it you can walk around. The second part of it, yeah, we're.

Arianna Santiago: 01:08 
 Gonna be going through the app. I can like sit down and.

Sherry Jiang: 01:10 
 Yeah, yeah, we'll be going over. It's not going to be the app app itself. There's gonna be like, we create like prototypes basically. But okay, that's fine. I'll let you know when we get to that part. But you can. Getting fresh air and taking a walk is highly recommended. So I. You do that. So yeah, tell me, tell me more about yourself. So like where you live, how old are you, what are you up to doing, what do you like to do for fun? All that stuff.

Arianna Santiago: 01:39 
 Definitely, yeah. So I am 25. I am currently in the Seattle area. I grew up in this area, went to Vanderbilt University in Nashville for undergrad and then moved back about two years ago. I work as a software engineer for Xbox at Microsoft. So that's super fun. My hobbies do not include gaming. Actually. I'm not really a gamer. Yeah, I got really lucky. I love my team. We get to do a lot of like user facing experiences which is really fun. And we get to do a lot of products that like are I guess kind of intended or like a lot of our audience is like non gamers. And I'm like, oh, that's perfect, that's me. I'm not a gamer. Yeah, I like, I love spending time outside. Like I said, I grew up in this area so I love hiking in the summer. I just got into snowboarding and like winter sports this winter. I love to knit. I like to read basically anything that Involves me, like, not looking at my screen like most other people, especially Gen Z. I do spend too much time doing scrolling, so I'm trying to like, pick up hobbies that don't involve that.

Sherry Jiang: 02:45 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 02:45 
 And then I really love to travel. When I was a kid, my parents, like took us around. My mom had a family in the Philippines, so we would go there every like five or six years. My dad grew up in Hawaii, so we'd go back every other year. And that kind of carried through, like me being in college, doing a semester abroad in Spain. And then now as a working adult with like, extra money, I love planning little weekend trips, like within the country and then also out of the country. I'm a sucker for a good deal. So, like, my boyfriend and I, we just went to Italy this past December because the flights were like 500 bucks. I was like, we might as well go. It was so crazy. Yeah. So I would say, like, I enjoy traveling, but most of the travel is more so motivated by like, if there's somewhere I'm interested in and there's a good deal. I'm not really one to splurge on like, luxury items or luxury travel. I definitely prioritize, like, experiences seeing people and food. I'd much rather spend like, my money on like a good meal as opposed to like sometimes like the convenience of like, oh, I'll just get. Buy lunch today. I'd rather save my money and like, get a nice dinner or something like that.

Sherry Jiang: 03:53 
 Got it, got it. Makes sense. Yeah, I. Long time ago, I actually lived in the Seattle area. Oh, awesome as well. Yeah, Yeah, I love, I love the Pacific Northwest. It's, it's a beautiful place. Yeah. Oh, well, that's, that's cool. So. Gotcha. So. So right now are you living with like, roommates? Are you living at home, living with a partner? Like, what's the.

Arianna Santiago: 04:24 
 I'm living with roommates. My roommate situation. There's a house that we live in. It's like a two unit, like upstairs, quote, unquote, apartment. Downstairs, quote, unquote apartment. So my part of the apartment, there are four girls total. And our rent is super cheap for the Seattle area. I pay $900 a month, including utilities, which is phenomenal. I met my roommates through like a friend who I know, like, growing up in this area. We've known each other since we were kids. And so he's actually dating one of my roommates. And so when they had an opening in this house, he was like, oh, like, you should go meet, meet them. Check it out. And it ended up being a perfect fit. It's about a 15 minute walk from where I go to church and like the community that's there. A 15 minute walk from the light rail, from the link that takes you up and down downtown Seattle to like the suburbs and then a 15 minute walk in like the, in between direction to the Microsoft shuttle buses that I used to commute to work. I do have a car, but I was like, if I can not have to sit in traffic every single day, I'll gladly take it. So I ended up being a perfect fit as far as what I was looking for for like commute. I knew I wanted to live with roommates just to have people to come home to talk to. And then obviously the price point, I was like, I am not going to find anything better.

Sherry Jiang: 05:47 
 So which, which neighborhood are you in?

Arianna Santiago: 05:50 
 I live kind of in the Ravenna neighborhood.

Sherry Jiang: 05:53 
 Okay, got it, got it.

Arianna Santiago: 05:54 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 05:55 
 And then you just like drive to like, I guess it's, it's. Oh my gosh, I'm blanking.

Arianna Santiago: 06:02 
 Roosevelt. I'm like in between Ravenna and Roosevelt, I guess.

Sherry Jiang: 06:05 
 Okay, got it, got it. Microsoft's campus in Bellevue still, right?

Arianna Santiago: 06:09 
 Yeah, Bellevue and Redmond. We have a couple offices out there. Gotcha.

Sherry Jiang: 06:13 
 So you go to the Bellevue side?

Arianna Santiago: 06:15 
 Yeah, I'm on, on the Redmond campus.

Sherry Jiang: 06:18 
 Okay, gotcha. Gotcha. Oh, wow, it's been so long. My brother lives in Seattle. I'm. Yeah, I'm supposed to visit him at some point. I miss the area. It's really cool. Yeah, that's cool. So, so I guess if you think about like your spending, right? Because this is a spending product. I like if you were to think about the last like, I mean, I guess the holidays is a weird period. So like let's say like last two months. Like, okay, what were some things that you spent money on that you felt like was like really worth it? Brought you a lot of enjoyment. You're like, I felt good about it.

Arianna Santiago: 06:58 
 Yeah, definitely. I mean holidays, like all the gifts and then this trip we took to Italy I think was probably my biggest expense. And the thing that I was like, okay, this is really worth it. Yeah, yeah. Like I mentioned earlier, I love good food, especially when I'm traveling. I do like going to the market and getting little things. But every time we're somewhere I'm like, okay, what is, what is it? That is this area's like special cuisine and I'll make sure to take part in that. And then also I guess in the same travel vein over New Year's, my boyfriend and I went up with some friends to Vancouver, bc.

Sherry Jiang: 07:31 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 07:32 
 And we went to a suspension bridge park there that was all decorated for the holidays. And even though the ticket, I think even like us, it was still 50, so. Which is probably like 75 Canadian. I think that was such a good use of my money just because it was like in nature. It was something that was super, super unique that I don't think we'll see a ton of other places. And we spent a full like two and a half hours there taking pictures, just wandering around. They had it decorated so beautifully. So I think that was something that was. Those are things I would say were really worth my spending that I wasn't necessarily that I had accounted for, but things that I wouldn't like spend money on in my day to day, if that makes sense.

Sherry Jiang: 08:13 
 Gotcha, Gotcha. So like you're like, okay, you know what? Like, those are good experiences. Like, I think it's like worthwhile.

Arianna Santiago: 08:20 
 Yeah, exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 08:21 
 Yeah. Gotcha. How about like anything that you spent money on that you like didn't feel as good about or you like regretted it or didn't think was worth it?

Arianna Santiago: 08:31 
 This is a good question. One thing that I think is just annoying to me and it's, it's probably because I grew up taking like the Washington state ferry system as a kid. So it's the car ferries and then passenger ferries every time I go because like I have to take the ferry to go see my parents go home. It's 20 bucks each way for me and my car, so it's worth it and that it gets me there. But it is kind of always ridiculous to me that like I'm paying $40 round trip for like, if I wanted to spend two and a half hours driving, it would be a lot cheaper.

Sherry Jiang: 09:05 
 Got it, got it. Oh, it's like taking your car like actually on the ferry and then the ferry.

Arianna Santiago: 09:09 
 Yes.

Sherry Jiang: 09:10 
 Stuff.

Arianna Santiago: 09:10 
 Yeah. Yes. So like, I wouldn't, I don't know if I would say, like, it's. I understand why it costs that much and like, I'm happy to pay it. But every time I do pay the toll and every time, like, especially during the summer, I'll take friends on because it's so beautiful. I'm like, damn, this is expensive.

Sherry Jiang: 09:23 
 Yeah. I guess if you were to reframe it and think of it as like $40 you spend to see family, like, would that make you feel better than this is on my car?

Arianna Santiago: 09:32 
 Yeah, I guess so. That is. Yeah. And I do try to frame it that way. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 09:41 
 Got it, got it. Do you, like, spend anything? Like, I guess, like, trying to think, how about things like shopping? You said you don't buy too much stuff.

Arianna Santiago: 09:52 
 Like, yeah, I. I try to be pretty disciplined in my shopping. I try to be really disciplined in my online shopping, especially because I think it's just so easy for me to like, find something and be like, oh, my gosh, this is so cool. Do so much research, research on it and then sell myself on it. So I've tried to cut down that habit a lot. One area I will still spend money on, I guess is like, if there's a new hobby that I'm just getting into, I've noticed in the first couple months of like being into that hobby, I will spend an excess there. So, like, when I picked up knitting, I think in the first couple months and I like, made my list of everything I wanted to make, I went to some places that had some good sales, and then I probably spent like 300 on yarn in the span of a month. And I told my boyfriend, I was like, okay, you have to stop me. I'm done for the year. This is in. This is in, like August. I'm like, there's no reason I should be buying more. I have enough to last week. So, like, stuff like that. And then like, when I picked up snowboarding, obviously I had to go, like, look for gear and stuff, so I was willing to splurge money there. But again, I think at heart, like, my mom grew up in an immigrant household. My dad, like, grew up in Hawaii, but like, kind of like a similar mindset. So I'm. I refuse to pay, like, full price for anything. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. But I'm always like, okay, how can I get a deal on something unless I figure out that, like, experience or like a product is high quality enough for me to justify the expense? Like, if it's something I will use for a long time or that's super high quality and only its value, then I'll spend more money on it.

Sherry Jiang: 11:27 
 Yeah, gotcha. Have you.

Arianna Santiago: 11:31 
 If you.

Sherry Jiang: 11:31 
 Have you ever spent like a lot on a hobby and then you didn't end up using, like, some of the stuff you got?

Arianna Santiago: 11:39 
 Yes. I would honestly say that's most of my knitting stuff right now. There's probably like $500 of yarn and supplies sitting like in my room right now. And I know I get to it at some point, but it has been sitting there for some time.

Sherry Jiang: 11:53 
 Got it. So, like, is it Kind of like. I mean, this is normally normal, by the way, but it's like, oh, you get really excited about a new hobby, and, like, it's like you're spending reflects the enthusiasm, and then you're like, I just want to get everything, and then it just kind of sits here a little bit.

Arianna Santiago: 12:07 
 Yes, I would agree with that statement.

Sherry Jiang: 12:10 
 Got it. Got it. No, that's. That's. That's. That's fair. And you said that you also, like, love to spend money on deals, which is also fine. Has there been times where that's gotten you into any, like, I would call, like, trouble, but, like, have you ever bought anything that you didn't? Like, like, looking back, you're like, oh, okay, I think I might have just bought it because it was a deal. Like, do you. Can you.

Arianna Santiago: 12:33 
 Yes. Yeah, definitely, I think. Oh, I was just. I was just going through a bunch of clothes, and I was like, oh, I bought this because it was on sale, but I didn't really need it. I think it was probably either some, like, outdoor gear, or I was at the outlet mall with, like, my cousins and my friends, and we were just kind of, like, looking for good deals, and I was like, oh, my gosh. Like, oh, I'll use this. I'll wear this. And I totally was going through my closet the other day, and I was like, I've worn this thing three times. That does not justify. Even though, like, I only paid whatever, like, I don't know, 70% of retail, like, I still. I would have been better off paying full price for something that I would have worn more times, I guess.

Sherry Jiang: 13:12 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 13:14 
 So.

Sherry Jiang: 13:18 
 So, like, basically, when you were, like, buying some stuff, like, did anything, did it go through your head that you're like, I might have only bought this because it was a deal, but if it was at full price, I might have not bought it?

Arianna Santiago: 13:29 
 Yes, absolutely.

Sherry Jiang: 13:31 
 And I guess, like, we do justify to ourselves sometimes in the moment. We're like, oh, like, it's a good deal. So, like, I'm gonna buy this. But then the deal kind of, I guess, stops us from kind of calculating, like, if we were to, like. Because if it's that full price and you think about it a little bit more.

Arianna Santiago: 13:48 
 Right, right. You're like, okay, it's this much. Like, I'm getting a good deal on it. I'm paying whatever, 30 less than I would have paid full price. But the question I try to ask myself now is like, well, what if it wasn't on sale? Would I still want it? Because then I would End up spending more money on something I don't need versus, like, if I had not bought it at all, I guess.

Sherry Jiang: 14:08 
 Yeah, yeah, I guess. Versus, like, okay, I spent the money here, but at full price, but I end up using it.

Arianna Santiago: 14:14 
 Exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 14:16 
 Got it. Was there any part of it, like, you mentioned, you know, you were like, at the outlet mall, I think, with friends or family. Like, do you ever just do it just for the social experience as well? Or, like, you don't have to get something, but it's just like, fun to buy stuff?

Arianna Santiago: 14:31 
 No, I, I. Yes, definitely the social aspect. I think I've saved so much money because I stopped, like, just stopping at the thrift store on the way home or like the area that I live in now just doesn't. It doesn't have as many, I guess, like, stores that I would just pop into because I'm really close to, like, one of the really nice malls you probably know, like the U Village Mall, University of Washington. And like, I'll pop in there, but I'm not as likely to go in there and window shop when I am out with family and friends and we're all shopping and someone's looking for something. Uh, my mindset's always kind of, oh, I want to get something. I don't know what I want to get, but I want to get something. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 15:13 
 So it's kind of like, I guess, proximity. Like, if it's there, like, proximity, like, it's just some, like, I guess there's like some rush of just buying stuff.

Arianna Santiago: 15:21 
 Yes, yes, exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 15:24 
 Got it. I guess, like, looking back, like, are you, like, you know what? Like, some of that might be okay. Like, it's just a fun experience. Like, you know, it's like you, I guess you pay for, like, having a day out or some of it. You feel like probably could have, like, put that towards something else.

Arianna Santiago: 15:38 
 Yeah, I think when I do do that, there is that, like, oh, I could have been something else. One thing I do, I have noticed this, I think, especially in the last year or two, and maybe because I'm out of college or whatever, but I'm just trying to be more conscious of if I'm gonna go shopping. Like, okay, what are my, like, 10 things I'm looking for? And I found I've gotten more picky. Like, if. If I find some pieces that I like, but I don't envision myself seeing them. Like, I try to envision, like, how I would use it in my everyday and if it doesn't fit, like something I'd use in my Everyday then I just like, I'm like, okay, well it's not the end of the world if I don't get this and then I regret it later. Because I'm sure I could find something similar like online.

Sherry Jiang: 16:19 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 16:22 
 Versus I think before I was like, oh, I'll try it on. Oh, like I like it enough. Oh, I could see myself liking it more I think especially in regards to clothes. I think a large part of that actually. Yeah, no, a big part of it is now living in Seattle and then working in tech. People don't really. And you, you would know this but like people don't really kind of dress up as much here. I'm still trying to figure out like what is the street style here, but it's very like I can totally get away with jeans on a sweatshirt every day. So even though I'm someone like I like to present myself well. I like feeling good about myself. I do find that like, well if nobody else is doing it, like I don't need to. As opposed to going to school in the south, people would always dress up to class. Even if they were an athleisure. They were in cute like, like tennis skirts and whatever. Especially during the summer, like girls would wear sundresses to class or whatever. And so I think being in that environment, it made me want to get more things kind to fit in. But I think also it let me like, I guess it kind of like externally validated like the joy I get from like shopping and from having new things to wear and presenting myself like in that way versus here. It's like, oh, it's cool. But like no one really cares. So I, that's not as important. I can, I can, I can, I can spend money on other things.

Sherry Jiang: 17:36 
 Yeah, no, I mean that's like a really like interesting observation that like your environment like has a huge impact because like, I mean, I agree. I mean I've been working in tech forever and my first job was in banking when I was an intern and. Wow, you again. Like it becomes like kind of your job to look presentable and like have certain things. And then after working in tech, I don't know, it's.

Arianna Santiago: 18:00 
 It's sometimes embarrassing.

Sherry Jiang: 18:01 
 I'm like, oh, I feel like I have days I dress like I was in college. Yes, Berkeley. So when I say in college, I don't mean like Vanderbilt, like South dress. Berkeley is like Seattle. Like people were like, yeah, Seattle.

Arianna Santiago: 18:13 
 Like sweats and whatever. Like it could be a sweatsuit, it might just be whatever.

Sherry Jiang: 18:17 
 On a good day you're welcome, Patagonia. Fancy, you know.

Arianna Santiago: 18:21 
 Yeah, exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 18:23 
 And then you're just like. And especially as, like, a female, like, there's like, a bunch of dudes around. You're just like, oh, like, I'm just like, you know, I don't want to, like, you know, stand up too much if I'm, like, wearing, like, a cute dress.

Arianna Santiago: 18:34 
 Right, exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 18:36 
 You're like, this is fine. Right. It's like, one less thing to worry about. Although, like, then, like, weekends are, like, the only time where it's, like, kind of fun to, like, dress up and, like, maybe girlfriends. But, like, during the week it's like, what's the point? Like, exactly.

Arianna Santiago: 18:52 
 Exactly. Yeah. I tried to implement a policy for myself of, like, okay, on Thursdays, I will dress nicer than normal. Like, I'll put something on that I know make me feel good. Especially because it's Thursday. It's almost the end of the week. And so that's, I think, just been so good for my mental health. And also just getting me out of the. I'm wearing sweatshirt and jeans for like, the fifth day in a row. Yeah, I know.

Sherry Jiang: 19:13 
 I think it's all about balance, right? I think you don't want it, like, every single day, seven days a week, because then you're like, I don't know, it gets boring. But then, yeah, trying to, like, look like you piece together an outfit every day, I think it's just exhausting. I'm like, I don't really. I don't really care that enough to, like. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, like, I mean, this is, I guess, a similar related question, but you, like, said that, like, you used to, like, online shop more and, like, you were trying to, like, change that habit. Like, yeah, like, you tell me more. Like, maybe in the past, like, what you were shopping for and on. And maybe this was back in college. Maybe this is like, after you graduated. But, like, would like to just.

Arianna Santiago: 19:55 
 I did so many, like, Gap and Old Navy and, oh, what was the other shirt? Mostly Gap and Old Navy orders, mostly my college friends mostly spun by someone getting an email saying, oh, there's free shipping. Do you want to get something? And I would just scroll through and be like, it's like $30. This would be fun. And just order things. And there were. Oh, my gosh, it was probably like at least once a month, if not more. We have a couple orders coming, going in and coming out. And I would say maybe like a quarter of this stuff that I got ended up returning just because it didn't fit right. But Most of the other stuff, I was like, okay, this is nice. This fits. I'm not in high school anymore. I can again, like, being in the south, going to school where people, like, dress well, being just. A lot of my friends just dress really well and wanting to fit in and wanting to be like that. And then when I moved to Seattle and I, like, picked up more outdoor stuff and I got into running, I think I was just on Amazon a lot or just like, on Instagram, like, oh, like, that's a cute. That's a cute set. I'll just get that. Like, oh, I need another jacket for, like, this weather. I have a raincoat, but I need, like, an in between. And even now, like, with snowboarding and stuff, like, I have. I got a, like a ski snowboarding jacket that's quite nice from REI that was on, like, again, I love a good deal. Like, it was returned. It was like 60 off. And then getting it and using it, I'm realizing, like, this will really work, but if I get caught in a rainstorm, might not work. So now I'm on looking for, like, another piece like that just online and looking at reviews. But I would say, like, my online shopping habits have changed from being in college and just being like, oh, like everyone else is getting something, or, oh, like, that's really cute. Let me just get it. Because I could. I could see myself wearing it to now. Like, okay, what is something that either other people like through, like, online reviews and things, or something that I know will fit my current wardrobe really well and I'll spend more time just looking at options as opposed to, like, going to the mall or going to a store and finding something that I'm like, okay, that works well enough.

Sherry Jiang: 22:10 
 Yeah, got it. So a little bit more, I guess, deliberate now than before. Was there, like, a turning point when you, like, decided to, like, shift your mindset that way?

Arianna Santiago: 22:23 
 I think at one point, maybe it was after I came back from my semester abroad in Spain. Maybe it was the summer when I was working. And, like, I. I actually looked at my checking account and I kind of just was looking at my credit card statement. And I think one of the. I think my credit card thing did like a. Oh, you spent this much percent of your money on this? And I realized I had spent like 600 on clothes in one in like two months. And I was like, okay, I need to give myself a budget. I need to give myself, like two or three hundred dollars of flex money. That could be for shopping or for, like, I don't know, just Getting whatever for, like, getting my nails done. Because if I keep being like this, I'm gonna end up with a lot of stuff. Especially because I was preparing to move, I'm like, I'm gonna end up with a lot of stuff I don't need or want. And, like, as I said before, I would realize, like, I'd rather spend this money on food. I'd rather spend this money on, like, getting drinks with friends downtown or something.

Sherry Jiang: 23:22 
 Yeah, got it. Got it. It's like. So you basically looked at your statement. You're like, oh, wow. Like this. I guess you call it, like, flex spending or, like, fund spending. You're like, oh, that's like, a lot higher than I expected.

Arianna Santiago: 23:34 
 Right.

Sherry Jiang: 23:35 
 And then, like, I guess for you, it's not so much just, like, the total amount you're spending, but it's like what you're spending it for. Like, if you can do more things with friends, you'd rather like, I guess, allocate that money there.

Arianna Santiago: 23:47 
 Yeah, yeah. To use what you said earlier, I guess I realized I wanted to be more deliberate. And what I was spending my money on, it wasn't so much. I was like, I'm spending, too. It's just I'm. I'm not spending money on things I. I would like to spend them on, I guess.

Sherry Jiang: 24:00 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 24:04 
 Makes.

Sherry Jiang: 24:04 
 Makes sense. Cool. Well, we're getting to the part where, like, you may want to find a park bench and sit down. Yeah. Now I actually want to ask, like, do you have, like. Do you have, like. Because I'm assuming you're on your phone, right, or.

Arianna Santiago: 24:20 
 Yes.

Sherry Jiang: 24:21 
 Okay. Do you have, like, any banks, statements or stuff available that you can get on your phone to, like, use on, I guess, Chachi pt?

Arianna Santiago: 24:33 
 Yes. I think I should be able to download, like, a PDF or something.

Sherry Jiang: 24:37 
 Okay, let's take a look if you can, like, do. Let's see. Do you remember the last time you had a typical schedule where you weren't traveling? Holidays are a little weird sometimes where you're like, yeah, not sure. Like, maybe you're dating.

Arianna Santiago: 25:00 
 Probably, like, October, November. Okay, so I can pull up that statement. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 25:08 
 I'm gonna send you a prompt. Basically, you can just run it with the statement. It's just gonna, like, summarize a few things, and then we're just gonna, like, walk through, like, I guess, how you feel about, like, certain things that, you know, you spent money on. Kind of like this. But we're gonna look at, like, some statements. Let me just send this to.

Arianna Santiago: 25:28 
 Okay. All right.

Sherry Jiang: 25:34 
 One second.

Arianna Santiago: 25:40 
 Okay, here we go.

Sherry Jiang: 25:44 
 Try this.

Arianna Santiago: 25:54 
 Okay. I'm saving the PDF when I do a chat GPT.

Sherry Jiang: 26:01 
 Yeah, either, like, any, like, AI that you're used to using is fine.

Arianna Santiago: 26:15 
 Copy. Okay, I'm gonna.

Sherry Jiang: 26:26 
 And once you're ready, if you're able to, like, share your screen, that would be great.

Arianna Santiago: 26:52 
 And just one statement, right?

Sherry Jiang: 26:54 
 Yeah. We can start with one month. Yeah. Pick either October or November, which. Whichever feels like your typical end of Ariana. Perfect.

Arianna Santiago: 27:07 
 Okay. Everything on your screen, perfect. See this? Yes. Okay, cool.

Sherry Jiang: 27:22 
 And this is on a. Okay, so this is on your credit card or like a one that you spend.

Arianna Santiago: 27:30 
 Yes.

Sherry Jiang: 27:31 
 Okay, cool.

Arianna Santiago: 27:32 
 Cool.

Sherry Jiang: 27:33 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 27:33 
 And I think this card I had just opened a month before, so I think most of my spending should be on this card because I had a, like, sign up bonus thing I was trying to hit.

Sherry Jiang: 27:45 
 All right.

Arianna Santiago: 27:48 
 Oh, this table is gonna make me. Oh, it fits in there.

Sherry Jiang: 27:51 
 Yeah. It's not exactly like mobile optimist. No, it's totally fine. Don't worry about it. Yeah, it should give more than this. Keep scrolling. Okay, cool. Oh, that's cool. You use Monarch.

Arianna Santiago: 28:11 
 I do. I just started using it because I was so tired of using my little spreadsheet. My little spreadsheet was awesome, but it was kind of a pain to maintain.

Sherry Jiang: 28:20 
 Yeah, got it. Got it. Yeah. Okay, that's cool.

Arianna Santiago: 28:33 
 Okay. I totally lied because some of these are not from when I was at home. But I would guess they are still typical spending. Like if my boyfriend. I were just hanging out and going out to eat or whatever.

Sherry Jiang: 28:44 
 Got it. So, Like, as you're going through, like, are any of these, like, surprising what you expected?

Arianna Santiago: 29:00 
 Kind of what I expected, I guess. Oh, see, maybe I should do the other month. Still spending money on travel because I must have bought flights for something. Yeah, I think this is pretty expected, I think. Okay. I'm curious to see what the other seven dining transactions are, but that is also not surprising to me.

Sherry Jiang: 29:23 
 You can probably ask in the. Yeah, you can probably type in the chat. Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 29:31 
 Dinner transactions.

Sherry Jiang: 29:47 
 Oh, were you in California?

Arianna Santiago: 29:49 
 It was in California. That's why I was like, I think I wasn't traveling. I totally was in California for like a week. But that's okay.

Sherry Jiang: 29:56 
 That's all good.

Arianna Santiago: 30:01 
 Yeah. So these are just like meals we had out shopping and then meeting up with friends, which is pretty similar to what we would have done if we were back here in Seattle. Just like going out with friends.

Sherry Jiang: 30:11 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 30:11 
 Oh, it's interesting.

Sherry Jiang: 30:12 
 They classified Vaughn's as eating out. I would. Yeah, groceries usually, but that's fine. Oh, 85 degrees. Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 30:22 
 Oh, I love 85 degree. We have one up here in like kind of by the airport and then one in Lynwood a couple like 20, 30 minutes north of me. And I'm really glad they don't have one closer because I would be there all the time because everything they have is so good and it's just, oh, it's so easy. If I'm hungry, I'm like, oh, perfect. Little snack.

Sherry Jiang: 30:43 
 Yeah. There was. I spent a summer in Orange county slash Irvine, and There was an 85 degrees nearby. I used to go there all the time and it was really good, but it was like terrible because I was fully gaining weight and everything.

Arianna Santiago: 30:57 
 It's like, it's like.

Sherry Jiang: 30:59 
 Yeah, I, it's, it's, it's, it's so good, but so dangerous.

Arianna Santiago: 31:15 
 It would be really interesting. The statement.

Sherry Jiang: 31:20 
 Sorry, what? Sorry, I just.

Arianna Santiago: 31:23 
 These shopping, both of these are my little knitting purchases. One is buying the PayPal, one is like buying a pattern for something I've yet to make and then the other one is buying yarn for something that I have yet to make. I guess those would fall in the category of like, do you buy things you regret, like not using them? Yes, but I know I use it. It just might not be when I originally thought I was going to use it.

Sherry Jiang: 31:45 
 Yeah. So we haven't used the petite knit one yet?

Arianna Santiago: 31:49 
 No, we have looked at it, but we haven't used it yet.

Sherry Jiang: 31:53 
 Acknowledged its presence.

Arianna Santiago: 31:56 
 Yes. Okay. And then this pickup food takeaway, the amount. So this is at the food courts at Microsoft. I do try to meal prep, especially like Trader Joe's and Costco. Like the ready made meals make it so easy. But there are weeks like last week where I'm like, I just cannot get to the grocery store. Yeah. And I'll just buy lunch every day and that's fine. But there is always a part of me that's like, I just spent however much like $60 this week on just the convenience of like not having to cook lunch when really like I could have spent that and had like a nice sushi dinner or something.

Sherry Jiang: 32:31 
 Gotcha. So like what number? Like, I guess like screams out to you, like, oh, why did I do that? Like, is it like if you spend like 50 bucks, 100 bucks, like on.

Arianna Santiago: 32:41 
 I would say on, like in the course of a week. I would say if it ends up being like, I don't know, more than $50 or $60 on, on just like the convenience of it. To me that's a lot. I know, it's like in the grand scheme of things, Not a lot, but it's just annoying to me because I'm like, it is so easy. I just go to the grocery store to just like get food and like the food that they have that is so easy to prepare at home or just like literally dump in my little Tupperware container is really good.

Sherry Jiang: 33:14 
 Yeah. Like, would you say like the groceries that you have like here like covers like most of the groceries that you have for the months or.

Arianna Santiago: 33:25 
 No, no, no, I, I don't. My. The statement is weird because it goes from like the middle of the month to the middle of the month. And I think for this one, I did most of my grocery shopping for October. Like it would have been the period prior.

Sherry Jiang: 33:38 
 Oh, okay, got it. So you, so you'd buy in like, do you buy in bulk?

Arianna Santiago: 33:43 
 You would say like, I would say it's a split. Like I try to go to Costco once a month and just pick up like frozen chicken nuggets or like, like they have bigger versions of like the, the Kevin's ready made meals where I can just like dump and go. So I would say I'll do like a couple things in bulk and then every other week I would say end up at Trader Joe's or end up at the grocery store and pick up like smaller things like vegetables or like pasta. And then I'll do like one off meals for dinner. But most of the time it is like something in bulk that I can just like spend zero time preparing.

Sherry Jiang: 34:22 
 Got it, got it. I guess like for you, like with food, it's either like, it's kind of like on this either it's like I'm deliberate about like I'm gonna spend money on an experience, like go out to eat and it's good. Or like I'd rather just like if it's like a day to day, you're like, I'd rather just like get like groceries for that than like, yeah, quick meals that you pick up.

Arianna Santiago: 34:43 
 I would agree with that. Even stuff like Chick Fil A and Chipotle. I'm like, they're good. But I'm like, but again, I could get Chipotle three times. I'm like, I'd rather take the second one.

Sherry Jiang: 34:56 
 Yeah. Oh yeah. Just like, I mean, it's like fast food's not that cheap anymore either.

Arianna Santiago: 35:01 
 No, it's not. Yeah, like, oh my gosh, $15 for a taco bowl. Yeah, right.

Sherry Jiang: 35:10 
 Or like exactly. It used to be, it used to be cheaper wash. I think like there's a time when Tripoli was like 10, 12 bucks, but that's not happening.

Arianna Santiago: 35:20 
 Yeah, exactly. If you want, I can throw another statement.

Sherry Jiang: 35:30 
 Yeah, yeah, let's do that.

Arianna Santiago: 35:40 
 It is kind of interesting because like now I have multiple credit cards. I try to keep track of and put different things on. So I'm trying to find the one that has the most action. See this one? Okay. That statement is just filled up with. What do you call it? Travel spending. Maybe one of these other ones. Man. I really just. You know what I think is also hurting me as far as like having fun things show up on my statement is that I was trying to like not spend a time with me in November because I knew I was going to be going on this trip. I wonder if I can just summarize all of my. Because I have Monarch. What if I can just get all my transactions from a certain month? Let's see here. It. Facebook. And also be so much easier. I'm like, why don't you just put everything on one card? Now I have to have things complicated. It's okay.

Sherry Jiang: 38:29 
 There's like different points and reward systems, so it's. It's understandable.

Arianna Santiago: 38:37 
 I don't think this is going to. Let me do this for my phone. Okay. Oh, well, let's just do this. All right. Let's get this one from September. Okay. Here we go. Save. This one. September. Oh my gosh. Where is this button? Okay. Okay. This is. Okay, These are two good ones. There we go. Okay, now I have three from like a period where I know I was just doing day to day things. We'll spit these in. Please repeat this process with these three statements which approximately cover September 2025 from this.

Sherry Jiang: 41:27 
 Okay.

Arianna Santiago: 41:32 
 10 minutes later.

Sherry Jiang: 41:34 
 All good.

Arianna Santiago: 41:34 
 All good. Okay, there we go. So it's still gonna have flight stuff on here, but it is also gonna have a lot of dining on here just because of. And a lot of shopping on here because this is a pretty. I was at home doing a lot of things. There we go. Cool. Okay, this is a good one. Okay, so the one that's here that I then I don't forget. I did. So this pizza one was. I bought a bunch of pizza for my birthday red pizza party. We did. Which was fun. $100 of that is extra pizza I bought at the last minute because I kind of panicked and didn't think I'll have. Would have enough food. Bought it and then ended up having to give it away because he had too much. And then. Yeah, a lot of dining on here because I think this month the weather was Good. I had birthdays. I had friends that were in town that were visiting. So just kind of a lot of dining out. Yeah. So you can see 15 dining transactions totaling a thousand dollars. If even if you take out the pizza, that's still like, what, like $500 in dining for the month, which. That was a very, like, dining heavy month. Let's see, what else was big here? I did know I wanted to. The alliance insurance is a travel insurance purchase I made just because I knew it was going to be doing a bunch of trips. The two Alaska things are like the Italy fights, I think. And then there's my almost $300 yarn purchase. So fun. I think after this month, I was like, okay, don't spend any more money in October, November, because you're gonna travel and you want to be able to switch when you're not in the country. Got it.

Sherry Jiang: 43:31 
 So would you like. Let's just like, minus out the pizza because, like, that's, like, for birthday. Like, would you say, like, 500 is your typical dining out kind of spend?

Arianna Santiago: 43:41 
 I think my typical is closer to, like, 400. When I. the start of last year, I think I was trying to keep it under 300, and I realized just we had a lot of people visiting over the summer. I wanted to be able to get together to people. My boyfriend and I were trying to be very intentional about, like, at least once a month going out and having a nice dinner. So that definitely increased it closer, like 4 and 500. I find during the summer, I spend a lot more dining out just because it's summer and people want to be out.

Sherry Jiang: 44:09 
 Yeah. Also, like, Seattle summers are amazing. So you just want to check out.

Arianna Santiago: 44:13 
 Yeah, exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 44:17 
 That makes sense. So how about, like, your shopping spend? I think there was more.

Arianna Santiago: 44:32 
 Okay, let me ask it to.

Sherry Jiang: 44:37 
 Yeah, maybe just like, show me. Shopping spend sorted by date.

Arianna Santiago: 44:57 
 I don't know why it says Cotopaxi, Utah. It's not in Utah, but okay.

Sherry Jiang: 45:04 
 Oh, interesting. Acorn Street.

Arianna Santiago: 45:07 
 Okay. Acorn street is the local yarn shop. This is what I was telling you. I said, do not let me spend more money on yarn.

Sherry Jiang: 45:16 
 Yeah. Okay, gotcha. So that plus I think you have, like, two other yarn purchases.

Arianna Santiago: 45:23 
 Yes.

Sherry Jiang: 45:23 
 The following month. Okay, got it.

Arianna Santiago: 45:26 
 Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 45:27 
 So most of shopping was just. Yeah. Also Emerald. Emerald City Yarn, I guess, is in there.

Arianna Santiago: 45:32 
 That was another, I guess, like, quote unquote impulse, because they had just opened and I was walking home and I was like, oh, let me just stop it and see.

Sherry Jiang: 45:40 
 Yeah. What's Cotopaxi?

Arianna Santiago: 45:48 
 Cotopaxi is like an Outdoor, like an outdoor gear kind of lifestyle brand. They, I think it must be maybe their headquarters are in Utah, but they have a store over here. And so I think this is probably paired with like some eating out purchase because my boyfriend and I went down to a new village and like got dinner and then we're checking out some of the stores and we love, we love their stuff. They're really fun, colorful year. So.

Sherry Jiang: 46:17 
 Yeah, got it, got it.

Arianna Santiago: 46:18 
 Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 46:19 
 I don't know why it says Utah. It's. I mean, it says it's. Oh, wait, actually it's Salt Lake City headquarters. Maybe that's why.

Arianna Santiago: 46:26 
 Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 46:27 
 Yeah, yeah, that could be why. I just like Utah. I mean, they're very outdoorsy there. So that was like. My best guess is like, the company makes sense. Okay, I got it.

Arianna Santiago: 46:36 
 Got it.

Sherry Jiang: 46:36 
 So, I mean, mostly most of it seems like it's hobby spending. Apple is probably supposed to be subscriptions, but it's. Yes, got it. So like, it seems like, I guess math. Math, like, math wise, it's like, okay, a big chunk was like travel, which is fine, like booking flights and stuff. Then it's like food, which, like, had you had like one like, I guess, outlier spend, which is like birthday stuff. And then the rest was like within kind of, I guess, the range of like how much you'd be spending on dining. And then the rest of the. This is like shopping spend on like hobbies. When you were looking through this, was there anything that like, stood out to you or like surprised you or made you feel a certain type of way?

Arianna Santiago: 47:23 
 No, I just think it's. It's good for me to look at it and remind myself. I think you nailed it on the head earlier of like my, my eating out habits fall under either like, I'm gonna just enjoy it or I'm gonna do it really conveniently. And so I think especially as time's gone on, I've given myself more permission to just spend more money eating out because I recognize that it's like I'm doing it with people. Yeah, there are a couple, I think on here there are a couple, like dining things where it was just me by myself. And that was like me taking myself on a little self day. But then afterward there was like, oh, like I could have done this without those people.

Sherry Jiang: 48:01 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 48:02 
 So, yeah, I guess you could see that in here. This is me. This, this month kind of reflects me giving myself that permission to be like, yeah, go hang out with people. Go. Yeah, go ask your roommates who are like all grad students or Teachers, like, if they want boba and, like, go pay for everybody's boba.

Sherry Jiang: 48:19 
 Yeah, yeah. That's intentional. That's okay. And you're like, you know what? Like, that's. That's something I said I would want to do, actually. What's an entertainment? I'm curious.

Arianna Santiago: 48:31 
 Oh, let's see. Can you do entertainment? It knows what that means.

Sherry Jiang: 48:46 
 Absolutely.

Arianna Santiago: 48:47 
 Oh, yes. Concerts. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, you know what? This. I'm surprised this doesn't have. This doesn't have some of the, like, beers and stuff we got. Actually, no, the Mary More Live stuff. This is not actually tickets. It's the drink vendors for a concert I went to with my cousin. So it's like an outdoor concert venue. So they have, like, drink vendors and stuff. So that. That's why they're both, like, 15, because it was beers that we got.

Sherry Jiang: 49:15 
 Okay, got it. Got it. Okay. So it seems like, I guess September 3rd. Sorry.

Arianna Santiago: 49:23 
 Oh, I was gonna say it's, like, not necessarily categorizing them correctly. I mean, it is in terms of, like, what's on there. But, like, now I'm looking at this. Yeah, The Marrymore Live. Those are. This is also more food and drink because Mary More Live. That was, like, the bar they had Live Aloha was like, a festival they did in Seattle center with a bunch of, like, Hawaiian culture events. And so that 20 bucks is either a donation or, like, food that I bought down there. Yeah. Let's see. Craft 75. I think that was also more dining. I was, like, dining at work. Although I think because they're, like, not one of their quote unquote food hall restaurants, it codes it, like, sorted differently. True north bars. Yeah. I went out with some friends, and we were, like, hanging out.

Sherry Jiang: 50:22 
 I know what doordash is in there.

Arianna Santiago: 50:27 
 Interesting.

Sherry Jiang: 50:29 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 50:32 
 Because it says it's movie or event night food. I definitely would have put that under dining.

Sherry Jiang: 50:38 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 50:38 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 50:39 
 I think GPT decided it's a categorization. Interesting. It's giving some thoughts there.

Arianna Santiago: 50:50 
 Oh, my gosh.

Sherry Jiang: 50:51 
 I had a question. I'm just trying to remember now. Yeah, I guess it's like, looking at this, like, entertainment isn't, like, a huge percentage, but, like, do you. Do you go. Would you say, like, you go, like, one side a month to, like, live events?

Arianna Santiago: 51:08 
 Yeah, I would say, like, once a month we go to, like, a concert or, like, the Mariners when they were in the playoffs. I bought tickets for one of the games to go. I think the thing with entertainment is that especially for some of, like, concerts and Stuff It's. I buy the ticket like months before. So it's not necessarily reflected the month I go. Right, right. But like earlier this year, I think one month I spent, I didn't, like, I was like, okay, don't buy any more tickets for things. Don't go to things. Because I had already spent like $600 in three months on different. Three or four different concerts. Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 51:40 
 So like, that's kind of your limit in your mind of it. You're like, okay, that's kind of a lot.

Arianna Santiago: 51:45 
 Yeah, I'll try to. I think right now I try to keep myself under like 150amonth for entertainment and tickets and stuff. Like, I'm gonna buy some tickets. Oh, I need to buy those. I'm gonna buy some tickets for a concert in June for my boyfriend's birthday. That's this month. But, like, that's his birthday present. So, like, when it comes to June, that's not gonna be part of that, but that's part of like the January. Yeah, the January plans.

Sherry Jiang: 52:07 
 Gotcha, gotcha. And how have you been using Monarch to like, I guess track some of this stuff or, like, look at it?

Arianna Santiago: 52:16 
 I have started using it recently. I started doing it in October to kind of like figure out how to do it before the new year. And so it has definitely been helpful, I think, especially because I like being able to just kind of check in and see how much I was spending. And I like how since it auto categorizes stuff pretty well, like when I get paid and I have to pay my cards off, I could just do a quick little five minute check in with myself. Like, oh, how much money am I spending? So, like, right now we're halfway through the month and I'm like, oh, I haven't really spent as much money as I had planned to on, like, eating out. So, like, if my boyfriend's on a trip right now visiting family, but like when he gets back, like to celebrate his birthday late, like if we want to have an extra nice dinner or something, or like if some of our friends are hanging out and they're like, oh, like, do you want to go to this concert last minute? That kind of thing. I know I have more local rooms to do that as opposed to before. Like I said with my spreadsheet would take some time to fill out. And so I'm like, oh, I kind of know how much I'm spending, but I'm not really sure.

Sherry Jiang: 53:18 
 Right, right. So, like, it made it feel like more anxious spending money because you weren't exactly sure. Like, where things are. But if you see it more clearly, you're like, okay, I can give myself the permission to spend.

Arianna Santiago: 53:29 
 Exactly, exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 53:31 
 Got it, got it. Do you have, by the way, a couple extra minutes? Because I. Sorry. Like, went way over on that part of the.

Arianna Santiago: 53:40 
 Yeah, yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 53:40 
 Research. And I do have, like, a mock app. I like, a prototype that I would love for you to play around with. Um, it's usually fake data, so it doesn't have, um. Yeah, it doesn't have, like, your data in it.

Arianna Santiago: 53:54 
 Okay, yeah, for sure.

Sherry Jiang: 54:01 
 Yeah. You should be able to just pull it up. It's a prototype, so, like, they might be bugs. If you can, like, present your screen as you go through it, that would be great.

Arianna Santiago: 54:18 
 Let me go back. Share my screen. Yeah, share my screen. I'm sorry. Lots of cars here.

Sherry Jiang: 54:45 
 Yeah, all good. I, I, the noise canceling is good. So I can still hear you.

Arianna Santiago: 54:49 
 Okay, perfect.

Sherry Jiang: 54:51 
 Yeah. So just like, imagine these are, like, yours. Like, replace, like, Zara with, like, I don't know, acorn or like H and M with something else. Like, this is basically shopping.

Arianna Santiago: 55:06 
 Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 55:06 
 The way that we designed this is for it to be reflection based, I guess, similar to, like, the way that, like, I was asking some questions, but this is, like a product version of it.

Arianna Santiago: 55:18 
 Okay.

Sherry Jiang: 55:23 
 Yeah. Feel free to, like, that play around and just, like, say what is on your mind as you're going through it.

Arianna Santiago: 55:29 
 Oh, I kind of like this. Is this, like, intended so, like, afterward you can see. You can see, like, how much was intentional versus not, or, like, just trying to get a, get a record of your own, like, shopping habits?

Sherry Jiang: 55:45 
 No, you're, you're exactly right. So, I mean, I guess you're, like, jumping ahead of it, which is fine, but essentially. No, no, no, that's totally fine. So basically, we're trying to help people reflect on, like, what was, like, essential spending. What was like, you know, you bought it on impulse and, like, didn't use it. What's, like, things that you care about. This one is an awareness test. So obviously this is not your actual spending, but basically with, like, food spending, it's like food and takeout. The issue is more around, like, I guess, awareness of how small things add up. So this is a was you. I'm like, how much do you think you spent?

Arianna Santiago: 56:35 
 I like that it's like, do you want it? I like that there's the ability to, like, not see it. Because I would imagine if you're like, well, never mind, I don't care. I like that there's an option to See it because sometimes I feel like I'll spend money and I'll see the total. I'm like, whatever, I don't care. But if I had seen what I set the money on, I would, I guess, be guilting myself more. Oh, I. Oh, it's interesting. They have a breakdown by day. Oh, wow. This is very in depth. Is not having to plan worth. Oh, these are good questions.

Sherry Jiang: 57:22 
 So I guess here it'd kind of be like, hey, like, people value different things. So, like, let's say you're like a convenience person. Really. You have a really busy life, Right. You work late hours, and if you're like, look, I doordash all the time, but, like, I need it for peace of mind after work, then, like, the app will just log that. It won't be like, oh, you should stop spending on food delivery. Like, oh, this is something that you. You said that you want, like, you care about. You want to track. We'll just, like, separate that out as a bucket. So, like, over time, you can see how much you're spending on, like, convenience.

Arianna Santiago: 57:52 
 On convenience things. Oh, I really, really like that. I really like that. I was just having a discussion with my boyfriend about that because he's like, yeah, it's worth it for me. I'm like, worth it for me. Because, like, if you're gonna go. Because also it's like, okay, if I'm gonna go order takeout, I still have to sit there and wait. Versus for me, if I'm hungry, I'm like, I could just. I could probably go to the grocery store, Trader Joe's, grab something, pop it in the microwave, and have it done before my food shows up. So it actually, that could be because I'm really. Oops. Is there a way to, like, undo it?

Sherry Jiang: 58:29 
 Yeah, just go back.

Arianna Santiago: 58:31 
 I just need to put away. Yes. Can I pick multiple?

Sherry Jiang: 58:40 
 Oh, so this is just one right now. So. So we divided the food one into two types. Like, one is, like, looking at it, like, overall to, like, help you see, like, okay, across the month, like, this is what it looked like.

Arianna Santiago: 58:58 
 And then.

Sherry Jiang: 58:59 
 But we also recognize that food could also be very specific with the context. So that's like the children ask, like, specifically, like, what was this for? And.

Arianna Santiago: 59:10 
 Right.

Sherry Jiang: 59:11 
 We're just trying to, like, take that information and just, like, develop, like, more of a. Yeah. Like a better understanding of, like, who you are as a person.

Arianna Santiago: 59:25 
 And is the idea, like, this would feed into, like, a dashboard or something?

Sherry Jiang: 59:30 
 Yeah, like, eventually you would basically have, like, labeled transactions or label things where it's like, okay, these are, I guess for maybe for you, the buckets could be like, here's your hobby spending, like on the things that you value. So it's like the yarn and the snowboarding. So then you can, like, look at it overall and you're like, okay, like, how much? Okay, maybe within, like the values you have. Travel, hobbies. And within hobbies, it's like yarn, sorry, knitting and like snowboarding. So you can see how much those are. And then I think within, like the things that you say are valuable is like connection. So like the dining out. So you can also tag because what like, we'll also try to do in this is separate. What is like Ariana, like, buying food last minute because it's convenient, and then Ariana, like intentionally going out to eat with friends. And those often get treated both as food before. Like some people, it's actually completely different. Right? Like, one is something you're like, deliberately, I care about this. And the other one is like, oh, I was just lazy and I could have like on the Trader Joe's.

Arianna Santiago: 01:00:43 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I really like that. Would. Would it be like those categories like you were saying, like, my buckets would be different. Would those be learned by like the AI and by the data that is collected, or is that something that, like, I would have to set up on my own?

Sherry Jiang: 01:01:00 
 Yeah, so it's. It's a bit of both. I mean, I mean, since you're an engineer, I could probably like, describe it, but basically we run some level of inference on our side just because we know some things, right? Like, generally speaking, like, if you're getting gas, that's probably not an impulse.

Arianna Santiago: 01:01:18 
 Then like, you probably need it.

Sherry Jiang: 01:01:19 
 Like, most people are not like dopamine spending on gas, but like, things like, things like takeout, like thing of meals that are like less than 20 bucks or like food delivery tend to be convenient, right? And you're spending on yourself going out to like a restaurant that's like 40, 50 bucks, like, if it's split or like, you know, you pay for the whole meal, that's usually with people. So we can kind of like run that kind of assumption on our side and present questions a certain type of way. So if it's like, if we think it's like a bunch of like you're eating because of convenience, like, we'll group them together is like, hey, this is your takeout spend. And then the other part that we do is then we basically ask you to provide essentially a label on it. But we're trying to make it more fun than just like, okay, here's like a form to fill up because that's really boring to do.

Arianna Santiago: 01:02:09 
 Yeah, exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 01:02:10 
 We're like, trying to create more of like, like a question based conversation where, like, it doesn't feel like too much energy to answer, but like, you're like, sharing this so that we kind of build a model on our side to understand your preferences and how you kind of think about.

Arianna Santiago: 01:02:30 
 No, I like it. I like, I like that there's a framework for like, I guess I'm someone. I like to have my thoughts not in my head, like, either on paper. Like using Monarch, I can go back and like, see what my habits are as opposed to, like trying to keep this all organized in my head. I can imagine it would be so nice to just be able to see at a glance, like, oh, this is why I did this. Especially, like, with what we were talking about earlier and me being like, yeah, I want to make sure if I'm. I want to be more intentional in how I'm spending and I can see like, oh, I am doing a good job. I'm staying on track of that. So, like, Yeah, I spent 600 this month on food, but it was all things that I intended to spend money on as opposed to just seeing it as a number.

Sherry Jiang: 01:03:12 
 Yeah, exactly. So we would like, label it essentially as like, I think we're still figuring out the categories. It'll basically be like intentional spend. Right. Of course, with intentional spend, you still want to see what the number is because sometimes you're like, oh, yeah. I mean, I want to intentionally spend on dining out, but if the number is like 900, you're like, okay, like, maybe I should take a look at it.

Arianna Santiago: 01:03:32 
 Right, exactly, exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 01:03:34 
 Or like yarn. You're like, okay, I'm intentional. Like, I want to spend on it. But like, okay, like, let's. Let's take a look at like, what's in there.

Arianna Santiago: 01:03:40 
 Exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 01:03:43 
 So one thing I can go on.

Arianna Santiago: 01:03:45 
 Yeah. Oh, I was gonna ask, would these like, check ins be on like a daily or weekly or monthly basis or kind of a mix of everything?

Sherry Jiang: 01:03:55 
 Yeah, we're still like, figuring it out, but we see that it's probably like a few times a week things. So I think generally there is like a weekly cadence that people have. Like, okay, maybe I want to see like, how much like my food habit kind of accumulated over the week. Right. But then there's also, like, things that are very weekend specific, which tend to be like entertainment or shopping. And so there might be like a review that Is more like a Sunday or Monday thing where you have, like, I see. You know, because it's. We also do it based on, like. And I have a bad memory. I think a lot of us don't remember things right.

Arianna Santiago: 01:04:36 
 Exactly.

Sherry Jiang: 01:04:37 
 So it's like, okay, if you. Right after the weekend, you're like. You remember. You're primed to think about the weekend. So there's like, that part of things. We'll also put a review if there's, like, unusual spend. As in, like, you're like. If you. Like, when I'm traveling, I think that's probably the easiest where you're like, okay, like, this doesn't seem like your typical rhythm. Right. Is there something that you want to tell the app? Right. So, yeah, it's more like every few days, but I don't think it's necessarily, like, it could be every day, but maybe, like, certain days you don't really spend much, so it's like, okay, like, I went to, like, I took the bus. Like, probably not that interesting.

Arianna Santiago: 01:05:17 
 Right, Right, right, right. No, that's super cool. I, like, I. I'm a really a big fan of, like, financial literacy in general. And so I think this is a really good way to, like, teach users. Like, yes, we're. We. We're storing all this for you to help you make decisions, but also, like, we're teaching you how to think about your money. Because I remember just having a lot of conversations as a kid. My family didn't have a ton of money when I was little, and so just like, going to the grocery store, my mom, and learning, like, oh, this is how you can, like, learn how to price things. So these are things, like, I'm always thinking about. But I realized, like, talking with different people, like, people aren't people don't think about their money in terms of, like, convenience or, like, being intentional. It's just, oh, I just spent this much.

Sherry Jiang: 01:06:03 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 01:06:03 
 So I like that with the chat and the conversation. I think that's a great way to not only have the data and present it to your users in that way so they can just have an overview, but also, I guess, help build that skill.

Sherry Jiang: 01:06:18 
 Yeah. And it's like, I guess helping you trace your behavior in a way as well, and then it's easier to see. Okay. I tend to be, like, an impulsive social spender. Right. Like, if anyone wants to, like, go and shop or go out to eat, like, I don't think about my budget. I just go. Right. And that's like. And again, these things are, like, not Necessarily good or bad, but it's more just like, if you know that that's happening, like, how do you feel about it? Like, would you do things different?

Arianna Santiago: 01:06:48 
 Mm.

Sherry Jiang: 01:06:51 
 I can show you something, because this is not on this page right now. Like, what it would look like. Look like, because we. We're also trying to, like, do it in a way that's, like. I guess you could call it a dashboard, but it's, like, different than a dashboard where we're trying to be more, I guess, visual with it. So we're, like, looking to organize it in these kind of, like, it's almost like a scrapbook way where, I mean, you don't see anything here but, like, let's say, say this month, you bought yarn. I'm just gonna use that example because what I remember, like, you just see, like, little yarn icons, and you're like.

Arianna Santiago: 01:07:30 
 Oh, okay, I know.

Sherry Jiang: 01:07:31 
 Like, I bought yarn. Maybe see, like, a backpack, if you, like, bought gear, or, like, a snowboard. And then maybe you have, like, a plane, and then, like, a little Italian flag. So it like, helps kind of, like, visualize, like, what you've spent on. And then over time, like. Like, as we get to know you better, these are the areas where we're gonna just mark down the patterns. Right now it says green, beige, and red flag. It's just, like, a very basic way to look at it now. But I think we'll also maybe categorize things. Like, these are the things you bought because it was a good deal. Yeah, you said it was a. These are things you bought because it was for people. So it might. Might be different than just, like, red, beige, and green. But, like, this is, like, at least, like, something we started out with, like, Right. Hey, supporting friends.

Arianna Santiago: 01:08:20 
 I really like that.

Sherry Jiang: 01:08:22 
 So, yeah, that's like, the end stage. So, like, as you're going through these, like, questions, like, it's not just, okay, you're answering questions, but, like, we're trying to build you a system to actually understand yourself. And it's like a. Yeah. Behavioral dashboard in a way where, like, it's not just like. But it's like, okay, it's like a journal.

Arianna Santiago: 01:08:39 
 It's like journaling and reflection. Yeah. So foreign money kind of. That's. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 01:08:45 
 No, you're exactly right. But, yeah, that's, like, kind of It. What a how? I guess, like, it was, like, really quick, but, like, what you think of, like, the kind of questions that were getting asked.

Arianna Santiago: 01:08:58 
 I. Like, I said earlier, I really like the questions because I like that it's conversational. And it's kind of chunked out. Like, I like that there wasn't multiple questions being asked at once. Yeah. And I like, again, that there was kind of the ability to, like, opt out of. If you didn't want to see more information, you're like, oh, it's fine. I do like that because I can. I could see, like, depending on how often people check notifications. I am guilty of always having a million notifications, of wanting to just kind of get through everything.

Sherry Jiang: 01:09:29 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 01:09:30 
 But, yeah, keeping it easy enough that, like, it would be easy to get through. And I thought the questions were super intuitive. And I do like that the questions that you're asking enable you guys to tag it as opposed to, like, me having to come up with my own tags. I know Monarch has, like, a million different ways you can use the tag system. I don't use any of them because I just. It's too much for me to think about, like, how I would label them.

Sherry Jiang: 01:09:56 
 Yeah, no, that's helpful. Anything else come to mind?

Arianna Santiago: 01:10:06 
 I did. I did download the app and I was kind of playing with it a little bit before we got on. I did notice that you're using Plaid for data connection. Are you plan. I guess this is the more technical question, but are you planning to only use plaid? Are you planning to add more things in the future? Because I know, like, there's also finished and some of the other ones.

Sherry Jiang: 01:10:28 
 Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 01:10:29 
 Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 01:10:30 
 I'm surprised you know all that. But that's cool. I guess you would. So we. We have explored with them. It's just more like, if there's demand for coverage for some of their, I guess, institutions that they have that aren't on plaid, like, we'll. We'll go ahead and do it. The. I guess the benefit of finicity is that they have. I mean, they have probably, like, slightly higher quality ways of, like, extracting data for some things because It's OAuth.

Arianna Santiago: 01:11:02 
 Right.

Sherry Jiang: 01:11:03 
 Versus just like, scraping. But for the most part, I think for now, we are going to use plaid until there's, like, I say, like, requests for, like, more. But yeah, we have a line with the finicity team. It's just more like, okay, once we have demand for, like, stuff that plaid's not covering, then, like, we can explore that.

Arianna Santiago: 01:11:21 
 Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sorry. I know that was a more technical question, but I know, like, especially with AI, everyone's like, oh, my gosh, privacy data. And that is one thing I was like, okay, plot is cool because it is just scripting. Like, there's nothing that can actually be connected. There's nothing that no. Presumably could happen with accounts.

Sherry Jiang: 01:11:38 
 No, you, you like, it's only read. It's like read like you can't go and execute anything. You cannot like, like technically wise, you can't do anything. Yeah.

Arianna Santiago: 01:11:51 
 Yeah, I guess those are my like main things. Yeah. And I thought it was really intuitive and I like the emojis. I am Gen Z, I assume the audience is Gen Z. So I think that's always a great way to do it. I think one thing that would be cool is like if the dashboard, I'm sure you're going to build this in, but if the dashboard can be customized to where like people can add sections or hide sections because I like to have information on everything. But like my boyfriend, he, he budgeted budgets at like a very high level. He's like, I know I can spend fifteen hundred dollars on like shopping, dining, whatever. And so that's how he thinks of his money. That would stress me the heck out. But I feel like being able to customize what like what you were showing me like on your desktop, that could be cool just depending on what people want.

Sherry Jiang: 01:12:46 
 Yeah. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah. Like we're, we're trying to find a way to make the make money yours as well. Like I guess visually like we're exploring like doing almost like a scrapbook style.

Arianna Santiago: 01:13:00 
 Where it's like, oh, that's cool.

Sherry Jiang: 01:13:01 
 Like see the like icons representing like your spend. That was be more fun than just like, oh yeah, here's like a ledger. Like.

Arianna Santiago: 01:13:13 
 That is super cool.

Sherry Jiang: 01:13:17 
 Awesome. I know we're like over time, so thank you for. Yeah, thank you for staying on. Of course. Appreciate it. I just have a question. I think. Did we get, did we get the study for like one or two sessions? I'm just trying to remember because I.

Arianna Santiago: 01:13:35 
 I think it might have been one session. I don't remember.

Sherry Jiang: 01:13:38 
 Okay, that's okay. I think we should be on the thread with Yash. Just check with him. If there's just one, then we're good. Then we're good. And like if we have future stuff coming up, we can reach out. If there's another session that's needed, then we can schedule it. But. Okay, sorry. Sometimes we run Ruler two and I'm like, I just like, no, no, no, you're okay. Yeah. But it was lovely to meet you, Ariana.

Arianna Santiago: 01:14:06 
 Thank you to meet you as well. Yeah.

Sherry Jiang: 01:14:08 
 Thanks for being so honest and like sharing all of this. It means a lot.

Arianna Santiago: 01:14:13 
 Yeah. And good luck with everything. This is super exciting and I'M excited to see where you guys take it.

Sherry Jiang: 01:14:18 
 Yeah, for sure. Thank you.

Arianna Santiago: 01:14:20 
 Thank you. Bye. Bye.
