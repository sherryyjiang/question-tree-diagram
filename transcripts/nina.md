Just finishing up another call, so thanks for your patience. 
All good. 
Awesome. Well, I'll do a quick intro, a little bit of background, and I would love to just, like, just dive into it and get to know you a bit better for. For this call. So I'm Sherry, and I'm doing research for a company called Peak. We're looking to understand a little bit more about how as young adults are making decisions, adult decisions around things like money, you know, a few years post call college. This interview will be divided into two parts. So the first one will be just a series of questions for me to get to know you and, like, how you've been thinking about budgeting and making some of these decisions. 
And the second part, we'll walk through an exercise together, which will be using some of your spending data and using chat GPT to do some analysis, just to, like, kind of talk through some things together. Any questions before we get into it? 
No, that all makes sense. 
Awesome. Well, tell me a little bit more about yourself. So things like where you live, what do you do right now, hobbies, age, like, all that stuff. 
Sure. So I'm Nina. I'm 23, about to be 24, and I live in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I moved here post grad in 2024 for, like, my first postgrad job. Yeah. And so I work with pnc and they're like debt, capital markets. Okay. And so just like analyst there. 
Okay, gotcha. Did you study finance in school or was this like a. Like a different kind of job that you found yourself getting into? 
No, I actually didn't study finance. I was an econ and history major and then kind of just fell into doing this job after an internship. So wasn't. Wasn't the plan initially, but. 
Okay, got it. And how was it, like, I guess, living in Pittsburgh? 
I'm. 
I'm guessing you moved to Pittsburgh, you said, after graduating. 
Mm, yeah. So I lived in New York City, went to New York City, or was in New York City for college and then moved to Pittsburgh after. It's colder here, especially right now, than New York City, so it's. It's definitely been a little bit of a change because I grew up in the Pacific Northwest too, so. Okay, got it. Yeah. Really different. 
Were you in, like, Washington or, like, Oregon or. 
A little bit of both. 
Oh, okay. 
I grew up, yeah, partially. My. My mom was Portland and my dad was in Seattle, so a little bit of both. 
Okay, got it. Yeah, I mean, the east coast is definitely a bit of a change from, I guess, Like Pacific Northwest. And how was it like, I guess, transitioning from like college to like post, I guess, new grad Life? That happened 20, 24. So I guess that's like almost two years ago now for you. Like, what was that like? 
Yeah, it was definitely, I mean, I kind of expected it to be a big shift in my life. And especially like, combined with moving to a new city, it was like having to get used to a new normal. Having to get used to like sitting in an office day in and day out was a little bit rough. But yeah, it's, it hasn't been like crisis driving or like super, you know, I feel as though it's, it hasn't been like the biggest shock in the world, but it definitely wasn't a, just. Yeah. 
What were you, what would you say were, I guess like one of the harder things to get used to when you like moved and started post grad life. Post grad, yeah. Post grad life. 
Yeah. I mean, I looked out in that. One of my best friends from high school also like ended up moving to Pittsburgh. So in terms of social circle, like, that was a little bit easier. And I think some things like finding an apartment and that sort of stuff was also maybe not as rough just because I lived in an apartment when I was in New York like the entire time. 
Okay, got it. 
But I think so because of that, like the biggest change was definitely around work. Right? 
Yeah, makes sense. And I guess when you think about like, you know, now you have this like, job where you're earning a paycheck, you're paying rent in a new city and all of this stuff, like how do you, I guess, manage a budget on your side or manage spending if you know? 
Yeah, I mean, I, I, I'm probably not like the most disciplined with my finances. Part of that is like moving from New York City to Pittsburgh. I'm like, everything's so cheap and rent cheap. Even though I feel like I, I actually like, definitely overpay rent here in Pittsburgh. But in general, I just have tried to maintain a similar lifestyle to what I had in college. And I buy frivolous things, but I don't buy like super expensive frivolous things. I don't have like a set budget that I keep for myself. Like I said, like, number that I have to stay under. And I do feel like I've done a pretty good job of like saving money, but more so because I have like a pretty generous paycheck firstly. 
And then, yeah, I, I, I don't generally get into the weeds of my own finances for. For better or worse, and spy for worse. 
No, I mean, that's. That's totally fine. When you said, like, you. You've tried to maintain, like, a similar lifestyle to, like, what you had in New York, like, what would you describe as your lifestyle as it comes to, like, the things you spend on, which also equate to, like, maybe the things you spend time on how you. 
Yeah, life. I was thinking about this. I was like, my biggest expense is probably eating. And part of that is, like, I eat. I buy lunch every single day. Yeah. And that's just, like, one area of my life that I probably, like, overspend on. But I think that was, like, a very similar thing in college where, like, I generally. I don't, like, buy workout classes or anything just because I have a gym in building. My biggest expenses, like, aside from utilities and rent, are probably food and coffee. 
Okay, gotcha. Not so much like, shopping or things like that. 
I. In general, I feel like I am pretty frugal when it comes to shopping, especially for, like, clothes. And I have, like, really not so great furniture. And part of this because I have a cat, and so I'm like, oh, she can destroy my furniture. That's fine. So, like, in terms of, like, things that I buy, I feel like I'm not necessarily buying the most expensive things. 
Yeah, got it. I. I have a cat, too. He's actually, like. He's, like, sitting right next to me. 
Oh, so cute. Hello. Is he a rag doll? 
He is. He's a. He's actually a kitten. He looks really big, but he's actually seven months. 
Yeah. Oh, my God. So cute. 
Put him down. He's. He's really clingy, so he just likes to hang out during my calls, so. 
Yeah, I've heard rag dolls are very clingy. 
Very, very clingy, but very cute.  yeah, also, yes, I get the part about not having crazy expensive furniture. They're. They're. Yeah, they're. They're gonna be destroyed in some way, so to speak? Yeah, I had a question. I'm just trying to remember.  so, when you. When you talk about, like, food spend. Right.  would you say, like, most of it is, like, food that you, like, pick up during the work day, or does it also include, like, times you spend on, like, going out to eat with, like, friends? It's, like, a mix of all of those things. 
I think it's probably a mix, but the. The food every day is a consistency. 
Okay, got it. And would you like. I guess in a way it's not always a bad thing. Like sometimes it's more of a convenience thing that like, I don't know, it's okay. But like, do you feel like it's something where you're like, oh, well, if I just saw the number or thought about it, I'd want to do something about it. 
Like probably. But that's one where I'm like I, I haven't seen the number and I could probably guess if I'm spending like an average of 20, it's like 100 a week because I go into the office every day. So yeah, like that would add up to what, like 5,000 or more dollars per year. So it definitely would be a large portion of my income. 
Yeah, yeah, got it. No worries. And then for like things like coffee, do you like get it every single day like for work or do you like do it for like, I guess like breaks or treats or. 
I go consistently like every day between 9 and 10 just to give like a break from my desk. It's like bit become routine. But I like if I'm meeting up like with a friend and we'll grab coffee or stuff like that. 
Yeah. Do you get to the office pretty early then? Because you said you do a break between like 10am because some people I think get into the office around like. 
9 and 10am yeah, generally I, I get in between like 8 and 8:30. 
Okay, gotcha. So it's kind of like your, I guess like morning pick me up type of thing. 
Yeah, I mean there's the occasional afternoon coffee too, especially if I'm like working late because I do end up staying at the office pretty late often too. So then that'll come in too. 
Yeah, no worries. Makes sense. And then you said something earlier that was kind of interesting. You said that like sometimes you do spend on like frivolous things if it's like not that expensive, like I guess outside of like food and coffee, like what would I have some of those things be. If you like think to your recent. 
Memory, I don't know whether it's like makeup or like random like hair things and, or like on my nails. Just like things that aren't necessarily like buying like a car but can add up. 
Yeah, got it. Like do you do those things often or is it just like once in a while like you feel like it and you go get it? 
Yeah, it's like, you know, honestly I like in as a Whole. I don't know how often I do it, but probably pretty often. 
Okay, got it. You're like, I'm not sure exactly, but it does happen regularly. 
Yeah. Part of this was like, because I looked at the app because I connected my bank information and it was like, you buy from Amazon like clockwork every Tuesday and Thursday. I was like, I didn't know that. That's kind of cool. Oh, but maybe. Sorry. No, go ahead. 
No, I was just like, oh. I was just curious, like, oh, what's Amazon? 
But yeah, so it was just that. That made me pause. It's like, I mean, it makes sense. I do buy often, but. Yeah. 
What? Oh. So like, I guess when you say, like, you get random things, like, is a lot of it, like, besides, I guess, like, obviously the in person stuff, which would be more like salons for nail. 
What. 
What are some of the things you do, I guess, remember getting from Amazon? 
Well, there are some things where it's like, not as frivolous. So like, I get my cat's wet food on Amazon and so like, that is like a pretty routine purchase. And I'll get like, toy for her on Amazon. I'm just looking at her. So that's why the cat things are coming to mind. But what else do I got? Just like small knickknacks, like, let me say, like even like nail polish or like, I don't know, like. Yeah, yeah. 
I'm. I'm also curious. Like, I mean, it sounds like there's some consistency as well. Like, do you have like, I guess, do you have things that you're thinking of buying and then you go on Amazon and buy it? Or is it like, I am just gonna browse because, like, it's something to do and I'll see what I find interesting. 
No, it's. I generally, I'll have something in mind. Yeah. And I'll put it in my cart and I'll think, I'm not gonna buy it right now, but if something else pops up, then I'll add that to my cart. And then if I have enough stuff accumulated, I'm like, I'm gonna. 
Okay, gotcha. So you do like, I guess you kind of have needs pop up during your day and then you go to Amazon ad and then at some point you're like, okay, there's enough stuff here. Like, I'll just like go and buy it. Yeah, got it. Makes sense. And if you're thinking about like the last, like, I guess the recent couple months, like, do you have anything you remember buying or spending money on that like brought you a lot of joy or you felt like it was really worth it. There's not just Amazon, but in general, like anything that you like, really enjoyed spending money on or thought like, yeah, it was a really good use of money. 
Yeah. I mean, I, I think things that I bought recently that like, are probably more expensive are like flights or like trips. Yeah. Like I went to the doctor in December and I bought that not that far before. Yeah. Like, I can spend a couple thousand and it'll make me happy. Even if they're like big ticket items or like flights back home. Right. God. 
So, like experiences like, or like. Yeah, good use of money. And. 
What about. 
I guess what about something that you spent money on that you didn't feel as good about or you kind of regretted it? 
I think maybe like, sorry, my cat's making a lot of noises, I don't know if you can hear. But like, if I buy something online and I don't like it, like if I buy a shirt online and it like doesn't fit the way that I want it to and I'm like too lazy to return it and it just like sits in my closet and I'm like, well, that's kind of a waste. But yeah. 
And I guess, like, if you, do you recall or remember like a specific time recently that you did it? 
I think I, I tried to buy some like a couple work tops like Banana Republic or something that did not end up looking the way that I wanted it to look. 
Okay, gotcha. 
Basically. 
Were you, were you buying some. Was there like an occasion that you were like buying it for? Like buying it for work or just work? Okay, got it. And was there a reason you picked, like, was there like a deal going on for those or did you just like, I guess imagine like them fitting into your wardrobe better than they actually did? 
I think, yeah, the latter. I, I actually, this purchase was a little bit ago, but I initially did it because I wanted to get like a pant fit for like an in person meeting that we had. Just buying a couple tops just while I was on the site. Yeah. 
Gotcha. And then did you end up. So the pantsuit like you ended up wearing for the meeting, all that, but it was the tops that like, you just ended up feeling like, okay, they didn't really quite fit as well as I thought they could. Yeah, got it. Cool. Anything else come to mind when it's like, spending that you either thought was like really awesome and worth It. Or spending that you thought was like, okay, could have passed on that. 
Nothing really comes to mind. But I feel like I very rarely regret spending. Spending money on food. That's so. That's good. Yeah, yeah. Like if I'm eating out for dinner, more so than just like everyday lunch. Yeah, it's an experience with like, friends or, you know, it's like a social thing and I feel like I don't regret that. Yeah, got it. 
All right, so we're gonna move to the next part of the research. So I'm gonna send you a prompt that you can use with GPT or whichever, like, I guess like AI model you have. You have like a. Do you have like a recent, like month, like statement from like a credit card or like somewhere where you spend some money? 
Yeah, I do. I have like, I can use my statement. 
I'll send you. The prompt to use should be. I mean, you work in finance, so I think this is pretty straightforward, but it just extracts like some summary. 
That's fine. Okay, sorry, I should download. 
How long have you had your cat? 
I've had her for a year this week. Oh, okay. So not super long. Here. She is. Oh, hi. 
Oh my gosh, she's adorable. 
She's a very sweet. Statement. Does it matter, like when the statement's from or. 
Yeah, I think like sometime recent. Whichever one feels like it's a typical month of spending, like. Yeah, I think that's fine. Okay, we can start with one. 
Hello. Okay. Chat. GPT. It. 
Yeah, when you have that ready, let. 
Me know if you can like share. 
Your screen so we can like follow along. 
Sure. I just uploaded it and it's loading right now. That might be my email. Are you able to see the. Yeah, okay. Yeah. 
So maybe like start from the top and basically you can just like kind of talk through like your like stream of consciousness thoughts as you're going through stuff. So things that you're like. Okay, that tracks. I remember that. Oh, okay. Like, that surprises me or. Yeah, just anything that comes to your mind. And I'll jump in if there's any specific questions that I have. 
Sure. So these are like the flight tickets I was referring to. I think those were. I went back to Seattle for Christmas. The 200s. Are the pet fees there. 
Oh, okay. 
Yeah. And then what did I buy at Nordstrom? I in theory bought something at Nordstrom, but I actually have no idea what I bought. Target is a mix of random things because I live above a Target, so this Target. And sometimes I go like, if I grabbing food or something. Right. Food delivery. I guess I didn't get any food delivered last month, which kind of surprises me. Possible usually. 
Do you usually order like Uber Eats or doordash or like some kind of food delivery? 
Uber Eats. And this is my Amex statement, so it might just be on a different card. 
Oh, okay, got it. Yeah, that might be it because sometimes it's. Yeah, I guess the transactions be separated. 
This coffee doesn't surprise me. It's my morning coffee. Seven transactions is actually fairly low because I think this is a month estimate. So part of that might be on other cards too. 
Got it. 
But lunch spots almost exclusively and then cafeteria at work. So that accounts for some of the other missing 20. Yeah, I guess I might only be missing a few days of lunch then. QFC is grocery store back in Seattle. I think I just stopped because my mom asked me to pick up food. Transport was heavy because I went home for the holidays. And then parking is pretty consistent heavy. I think my subscriptions are on a different credit card. My utilities and bills get charged directly to my bank account. 
Oh, okay, got it. 
Because I have that connected to like built or something that my building uses. That was a deposit for a dentist. 
A Rovers Pets. 
Yeah, yeah. Robert's pet. Yeah, I used it when I was traveling for work I think. But none of these really surprised me all that much. Yeah. 
Was there one like, was there any that like I guess on the Nordstrom one? That was the one that you mentioned. You're not sure what that was, right? 
Yes. 
Okay, now maybe let's see. It might tell you the. Does it help that it tells you the date here? Because it was the 24th, which is around Christmas. 
Yeah, it was around Christmas. But I don't think it was a Christmas present because I. Oh, okay. I'm. I'm definitely like forgetting something that I did buy and I'm tempted to look at my email to see if I got a receipt. 
Are you pretty sure you got it for. I guess it would be for like you think it was. 
Yeah. Okay. I did get this. I went in person the day before Christmas to get my mom a present. 
Oh, okay. 
Nordstrom. Okay. 
Got it. Got it. Makes sense. Is there, is there anything you're looking at where like you feel like you are pretty happy with like how you spend? You're like, you know, I'm proud of myself that this is like what I kept it within. 
I. I'm actually surprised that the food is as low as it is or pick up food takeaway. 
Yeah. 
So I'm. I'm fairly happy with. With that, and also kind of happy. I mean, it's unnecessary because I do have, like, two coffee machines that the coffee is not, like, super high. 
Yeah. And is there anything that you're looking at here where you feel like, okay, I think I could do a little better than this. 
Maybe the target. Just because I feel like that's just, like, random stuff that I get because the target is in my building. Yeah. 
Like, do you feel like it's stuff that, like, you might be just kind of getting it, like, on impulse or, like, in the moment and you're not quite sure, like, how these add up? 
I think it's a combination because I will, like, if I run out of, like, eggs or something, I just like. 
Right. 
Target. But I do think that there's a level of, like, impulse buying. Like, I remember just because this is, like, my December statement, like, buying, like, multiple gingerbread houses to make a target for, like, no reason. 
Okay. 
Yeah. Just because I, like, saw it when I was walking down, like, an aisle. 
Okay. 
Yeah. 
I mean, did you, like. I mean, but did you, like, feel, like, happy getting it, or did it feel kind of nice to get? Or you're like, okay, well, maybe it wasn't necessary. 
Oh, 100%. I mean, I. I think that, like, the spending that I do, a lot of it is to, like, feel happiness in that moment. Yeah. Which, you know, is. Is not a terrible thing, I guess, if. If I acknowledge that. And I also think, like, compared to what I make, it's. It's nothing. That's, like, crazy excessive. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Makes sense. 
Yeah. 
For sure. And I. I'm just curious, like, because it says, like, 11 transactions. 
Try. 
See if you could ask GPT. Like, can you split the target transactions into. Or, like, put them in chronological order? 
Yeah, Yeah. They're all exposed purchases. 
Oh, got it. So they're basically, like, around $20 or so. 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
So it's. It's not like, made of big ticket items or anything. 
Gotcha. Gotcha. Were you surprised by how much the number was? Or you're like, okay, that makes sense. 
Like, you know, obviously it makes sense. I feel like I go at least, like, twice after work. Yeah. 
Gotcha. 
A week. Twice a week. 
Okay. So, like, you come back, and then you. 
You're. 
I guess, like, home is right there. 
You. 
You drop in. Sometimes you're like, okay, I have, like, eggs. I know I'm running out of. I'll go get it. And then sometimes. Okay, there's something else that looks Interesting. Like, I'll just get that as well. 
Yeah. I mean, there's an elevator to the Target for my apartment, too, sometimes I, like, I'll stop by Target on the way home and then go home from, like, inside the Target. So it's, like, a little too convenient, I think. 
Yeah, got it. So, like, they're like. I guess if you think about it, there, like, might be some things that you might not get. Unless Target was, like, that close to you. 
Yeah. 
Okay. Gotcha. 
Cool. 
And do you have, like, I guess during this time period, do you have another, like, statement that you think, like, captures, like, a portion of your spend as well? Probably. 
I can. I have a couple credit cards. Honestly, I feel like the bank statement as a whole is probably a better representation, if anything. Okay. 
Is this the. Sorry, is this a bank statement or. This is the credit card. 
This is a credit card. 
Oh, okay. Got it. 
Okay. Statements. I can do the same month from my bank. I guess it cuts off halfway through the month, but, Yeah, this is probably where the bigger items are. Just, like, the things that are charged directly to my bank account. It. I might stop sharing for a second. It. I'll just ask it to do the same thing. 
Sounds good. 
Okay. Yeah. So wrench here. Costco hot dogs, because they don't take amx, And my boyfriend got that one. Same thing with the amex and the Dr. Uber one looks like for food and stuff. Xfinity. That doesn't surprise me. Like, the electric company. Yeah. 
Oh, God. So these. These are more like, I guess, like, the essential bills, then. Okay. 
Got. Those. Yeah, the ones that I charge directly to. The bank, and then. I have a Visa card as well, but, like, I don't spend that much. 
On it, so actually, amex seems like most of the, like, I guess, discretionary spend, like, outside of bills. 
It is. 
Okay, Got it. Cool. I think one last thing to do, if you don't mind, is do you have something from Amex? 
Maybe? 
In what month did we check? I think it was December that were looking at. Do you have it for, like, one month before? Because sometimes the December period can, like, include, like, travel or, like, things at home that is a little different. 
Yeah. Pull up a December statement. 
Yeah, just, like, from the month prior. 
It. So, yeah, I'll do october to november. Okay. Yeah. Looks like I did spend more there. It. Do. Okay. So I booked the trip from myself and my boyfriend. Yeah, the coffee. I was talking about Target I bought directly from Sephora, which I feel like I don't Normally buy directly TSA PreCheck. I bought that. Other random coffee, which I guess is also in there. 
Is Parkhurst, I guess by your office. 
Yeah, that is my office building. So it's coffee in there. 
Okay, got it. So it's the place you stop by, like, morning and, like, sometimes during the day. 
Yep. In general. And then it's also the name of the cafeteria, so that's included in there as well. Restaurants and bars, Flights, Another bar, and a Rover tip for something that was paid in an earlier cycle, I think. Yeah, nothing. Nothing surprises me too much in here. 
Gotcha. Do you know, do you remember what the Sephora one was for? I know it's like a long time ago, so. 
Yeah, Maybe it was like, lipstick. Yeah. I feel like oftentimes I get stuff off of, like, Amazon as opposed to, like, directly from Sephora or Ulta. Yeah. 
So it's. It's more like online shopping than it normally would be, like, in person. Got it. And I guess when you're looking at this, what are some areas of your spending that you feel, like, proud of, that you, like, kept within, I guess, an expected range? Maybe. 
Like, I'm. I'm actually surprised. Like, it's. It's still like 12 transactions in the pickup food, not including the days I go to the cafeteria, but I'm surprised it's not more. I would expect the average to be a little higher. Like, I guess not as great. Great with the travel stuff, but it's kind of expected. And I guess health and fitness. Not sure that's necessarily something to be proud of, but zero dollars. 
And then anything you look at where you're like, oh, I. I might, like, take a second look at that to see, like, if there's any habits I might reconsider or you're like, this is pretty okay. 
Honestly, I feel like I'm pretty okay. Once again with, like, the takeout food. I feel like that's something that I do want to get better at, but it wasn't as bad as I expected. And if we're at the office past seven, then, and they pay for our food. Okay, that's so. 
So maybe like, yeah, maybe you were. I'm wondering if it's possible you're over counting in your head, like, how much you think you spend on food, because maybe some of it is actually just covered by work. 
It's very possible. Yeah. Got it. Cool. 
I think that's actually it in terms of my questions. Thank you so much for, like, walking me through this and for your time. As well. 
Yeah, of course. Happy to. Happy to do it. Yeah. 
Awesome. Well, hope you have a great rest of your day. Yeah. And thanks for. Thanks for sharing. 
Yeah, of course. Thank you. It was nice to meet you. 
Nice to meet you, too. 
All right. Bye. Take care. Bye. 
Bye.
