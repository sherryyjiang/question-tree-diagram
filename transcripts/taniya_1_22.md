Hi, Tanya. Hi. Hello. 
Hello. 
Doing good. 
How are you? I'm good, I'm good. 
Good to see you again. And I just want to start out by saying if there was any, you know, communication that wasn't clear on our side about the structure of the study and the payout, I. I do want to apologize for that and thank you for your patience on it. Oh, yeah, you're fine. I'm sorry. 
I think I was confused, too. 
I just thought, like, it was like one hour call. 
I didn't know it was 21 hours. 
So I think I was like, yeah, it's okay. We went back and were going to just change, like, the way that it's positioned because, like, I can see how it could be confusing because we're calling it like one study, but then there's like two conversations, so we'll just make it a lot more clear. So, like, that's not a point of confusion. So thanks for bearing with us on that and yeah, glad it was okay. And good to talk to you again. 
Yeah, of course. 
Yeah. So I'll explain how this is going to work a little bit differently. So last time we spent the time, you know, asking some questions about you in general, and then we had a app that were going through for today. What I'm going to have you do is prepare. I ideally, like, two bank statements around spending. So it could be your bank account or it could be like a credit card, whichever one that you have more activity around. And then do you have, like, ChatGPT on your device or some large language model that you use? 
Yeah, I use Chat GPT online. 
I'm on my laptop, so. 
Yeah. Okay, perfect. So what I'm going to do is I have a set of. So we're going to actually run the app on ChatGPT, since it's a bit more flexible. I'm going to send you a set of instructions. All you have to do is take those instructions and then add. Let's just take one month of a statement first. And then what the instructions will do is basically extract some summaries of the spending and then we'll just go through and, like, kind of talk through it. 
So. 
Any questions on that? 
No. 
So I should just like, download, like. 
One month's bank statement, I guess, to upload. Let's. 
Let's start with one month. Usually we end up covering two months because, like, one month at a time. Because sometimes one. One month is very, like, specific. Like, sometimes it's your birthday month, sometimes you're traveling or it's Holiday. So it's. It's helpful to see too, because you're okay. Like, this might be a bit more normal on these areas. So let me send you the instructions. I'll just send it in the chat. 
Okay, perfect. 
Yeah, so feel free to take a little bit of time to get everything set up. And when you're ready, just feel free to share your screen so can be on the same page and looking at the same thing. But take your time. I'll just wait here when you're ready. 
Perfect. Thank you. Okay. 
Okay, so you just want me to. 
Copy this and paste it into ChatGPT? 
Yes, that's correct. So the copied instructions into ChatGPT plus your statement should be able to generate everything that you need. 
Okay. 
I feel like I might have to do this on my phone because my bank's name isn't uploading on my computer. 
Yeah, I think phone should be fine. 
Okay, cool. Sorry, I don't know what the heck going on with this. It. Okay, I think we have it now. I'm gonna share my scre. 
Okay. 
How do I share this entire screen? Okay, Let me know if you see it. Oh, yeah, For some reason this is not working with chat GPT, so I don't know. 
Oh, I think you're on mute. 
I can't hear you. 
Oh my gosh. I just been speaking into it. Are you able to copy, paste. 
Copy and paste my bank? 
Yeah, just the. Yeah, just like the transactions. 
I can try. This is how my bank has it. So like their transactions are more like. In like this type of form. 
Oh, okay. Actually, I think you can probably take three screenshots and it should work. 
Take screenshots? 
Yeah. 
Okay. Yeah, It. 
You've got to mute one of your. 
Yeah, I'm gonna leave that one. Okay. We're just gonna do it on my. 
Phone since I have to do a screenshot. 
Yeah. 
Can you. 
I can see and hear you. 
Yeah. 
Can you just re. 
Copy the thing that I'm supposed to do? 
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, no problem. Let me just pull that up again. 
Thank you. There you go. Perfect. Okay, Sam. Okay, I'm going to screen share. Okay. This is what chatgpt said. Do you see it? 
Oh, I don't see. I think you have to share the screen. 
Okay. I said it's broadcasting. 
Oh, okay, perfect. I can see it now. 
Okay, cool. 
Okay. Yeah. So I guess for this, just kind of go through from top to bottom and just kind of, I guess, react with your first thoughts. Anything that tracks, things that surprise you, things you don't remember. Yeah, and then I'll jump in with any specific questions. 
Yeah, that's fine. 
Oh, this is only 1-16-19. 
Yeah, so I, when I try to upload three screenshots, I said it only takes two at a time. The two from the most recent. 
Okay. 
Yeah. Okay. 
Can you see if you can add in more here? Just say, click the plus ask anything. 
Okay. Because it still has a lot of transactions on here. 
But I can add another one. 
Yeah, see if you can just. 
Oh. 
Oh no. That's going to create an image. 
Might because I don't have Pro. 
So I don't think you can do more than two. Yeah, you need the pro to like do more. 
Okay. Okay, no worries. Yeah, I guess we start with like what we can do here and then we probably have to start a new chat then for the rest. That's okay. We, we just, we do with what. We'll, we'll make do with what we can do here. Yeah, yeah. 
So you need a whole month or you just need like transactions in total? 
Oh yeah, it works best as a whole month. 
Oh, okay. 
But it's okay, let's just start with. Yeah, let's just start with this. This is like a couple days right now. 
Yeah, yeah. 
Okay, so here's where the transaction started. 
Do you have any questions about anything? 
Yeah, I mean it's, I'm trying to think where there's like. Yeah, let me see. Maybe go to the shopping one. Yeah, there's just. Or was there any shopping here? 
Yeah. Okay. 
Do you know what Amazon One Medical is? 
Yeah, I was trying to get like this prescription from there, but I don't think it worked. So they just charged me like 29 to like speak to like Amazon provider or something like that. 
Yeah, got it. Yeah, I'm just trying to think of how to do this because usually yeah, one month is more helpful. I'm just trying to think what we can do. Let's see. Do you have, do you go to gemini.com gemini.google.com I think the free version might be able to allow you to upload multiple spreadsheets. And multiple screenshots. Yeah. 
Okay. 
So yeah, upload files though. 
Like let me upload the. 
Thing. My gosh, why? My method is not working anymore. 
This is so stupid. 
I have the file right here. 
I wonder if this one will work. Cuz I feel like this is like the whole month's worth. Which would better. 
Yeah, but I don't even know if. 
They'Ll let me do that. 
Try saving it down. Yeah. Save to files. 
Yeah. 
Okay, let's try. Oh, perfect. Okay. 
All right. 
Okay. 
I think we just needed to switch to Gemini. That sounds like. Yeah, okay, got it. Now I think there's more information for you to look through. Okay. I mean, maybe my first question is, for this period, seems like the two biggest were Amazon and Starbucks. Were those expected during this time period or do you know what those were for? 
No, I actually don't remember spending that much on Amazon and Target. 
Yeah. 
But I think around this time it was Christmas, so I feel like Amazon. That's why I spent the most. It was Starbucks. I don't know. I guess I was just thirsty. 
Yeah. 
Wow, this is interesting. Okay. 
Is there a. I guess a particular area that you'd be curious to, like, dive into or ask more questions in? 
Yeah, probably the shopping. 
Right. So maybe ask Gemini 3. Hey, could you give me a. You go to the chat. I can just give you about. Hey, could you give me a more detailed breakdown of my shopping spend? You can ask it to maybe sort it in chronological order. Yeah. So you can see almost like. Yeah. Throughout the month. 
Okay, that makes sense. Nice. Wow. This is actually a pretty good system. So are you. 
By comparing this to any. How your app does it, is that what we're doing with this call? 
So I'm actually trying to figure out the best way to, like, understand each spending areas and using that to make. Yeah, so we're not going to have this kind of exact system, but chat is one of the best. Like, this AI Chat is one of the best ways to be really flexible around how we arrange the data. So that's why. But you said that, like, arranging it this way was helpful. Like, could you articulate, like, I guess, what you mean by that? 
Yeah, I mean, I guess it's just nice to see, like, a spreadsheet of everything. It's not too much information. Like, it's just clear with the date, the emergent, and the amount. So it kind of helps put everything into perspective. 
Yeah. Like, after looking at this, does it make you feel like you understand where the spend is going more? 
Yes, definitely. It makes me want to, like, budget more appropriately. 
Like, looking at, I guess, these spends. Like, do you remember, like, what some of those were for? 
Yeah, I do. A lot of these were Christmas gifts from, like, Breast Fashion, Nova Sheen. Yeah, almost all of these were actually, like, Christmas gifts. 
Okay, what amount do you think was for gifts versus, like, stuff that you bought for yourself? 
How much is this total? Oh, it doesn't say. 
Oh, okay, 888. I feel like maybe, like, 500 was for gifts, and then, like, 300 for myself. 
Got it. Got it. And for, I guess, the 300, that is for yourself, would you say that's, like, typical for this month, or did you spend a little bit more because, like, you know, holiday season for yourself? 
Probably a little more because it was holiday season. 
Got it. And looking at this, like, do you feel like you are, like, good with the amount that you spend here because it's holidays, or does it make you feel like you may want to budget more in the future or at least dig into some of this a bit more? 
No, I think I spent, like, a good amount for the holidays. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Gotcha. And I guess outside of. Outside of shopping, was there any, I guess, area of spending that, like, sparked your curiosity to want to learn more about. 
Oh, let's see. 
Definitely. 
Dining. 
Yeah, I think that category I want to learn more about. 
Oh, the rest. 
The restaurant is the dining. 
Restaurants. Yeah. 
Okay. 
We're. I guess before looking at this number, like, did you have an expectation of how much you thought you would have spent? 
Yeah, I thought it would be, like. 
A little bit less for dining. I didn't think it would be, like, $600. I feel like my expectation would maybe be, like, 300, $200. So that's a lot more than what I thought. 
Okay. 
Maybe you can try asking it again. Like, hey, could you give me a breakdown of my dining and restaurant spend? And it should. Yeah, I'd be able to do. Do that. I hope it's in chronological order. 
Oh, yeah. 
Okay. 
Yeah, it is perfect. Okay. 
Yeah. See, this is only, like, 141. 
That's why I was like, I wonder. 
Why it said, like, 600. 
Actually, could you ask it? I just hope it's not, because. Could you ask it? Did you include. 
Ask it. 
Did it include what? 
Yeah, I'm just looking at the. Did you include all restaurants in this? 
Yeah. Let me see. 
Because it looks like it's like the Chipotle. 
Yeah. 
Which if this is. 
I feel like this is right. 
Because I don't remember myself spending, like, 600 on the rest. Guys. I don't think I would ever do that. 
Okay, maybe they put. Oh, okay. Maybe there was. 
Okay, maybe like. 
Oh, okay, that makes sense then. 
Yeah. Where did the 600 come from? I'm just like, yeah, that's. 
I made a mistake probably. 
Okay, got it. Does this seem more like what you would have expected? 
Yeah, this is definitely expected. 
Yeah. 
Okay, got it. Got it. Yeah, that's Then I think maybe it got it wrong, but listed it out. I think this is. Yeah, about 200 or so. 
Yeah. 
I'm curious now. Can you go all the way back up? I'm just like, what did it pick up as dining? Like, largest. Oh, scroll down a bit. Yeah. There was something that says high end at the capital. Yeah. Are these familiar to you? 
No, actually. 
Yeah. I don't remember eating at any of these places. 
Oh, wait. 
Let me see. Founding farmers. Okay. 
The Capital Grill, 1220. 
That's so interesting. I don't remember this. 
Okay. I mean, I just hope it's not making it up, but that seems to. I mean, anyways, I think what's calculated here, it's assuming that you probably, like, put like split the bill with people at these places, right? 
Yeah. 
I don't think anyone's spending like 240 bucks there. But in any case, that's okay. I think that's where the discrepancy is coming from. 
Right. 
The rest, I think, are ones that you recognize. 
Yeah, definitely. 
Okay, got it. So when you see like the 233, then you're like, does that. That's pretty in line with what you would have expected. 
Yes. Yeah. 
Okay, got it. And is there anything that, like, you're looking at here for your spending that you feel like you feel proud of, that you, like, were able to manage to this kind of budget? 
Let's see. Yeah, maybe my subscriptions, I think I'm proud that they're very low. Yeah, yeah, definitely. And like, my transportation, I think that's good too. 
Anything that you, like, look at here. 
Where. 
You feel like, a little less proud of or like you want to revisit potentially in the future? 
Yeah, probably the coffee. 
I think I want to revisit that for sure. 
When you, like, looked at, like, coffee spend, I guess, like, what was your expectation or what did you think it was going to be? 
Yeah, I thought it would be like $20, not 145. 
Yeah, I thought it would be a. 
Lot lower than this. 
Okay. When you look at the coffee spins, do you recognize them? Like, do you recognize, like. Oh, I did maybe. Go on. These days. 
Let'S see. 
I don't even see where it has the coffee days on there. I might ask them to show me the coffee. 
Huh? 
Why is it saying that? 
Yeah, okay. 
Actually, if you. Do you mind just like cross referencing maybe in the original statement and just seeing if there's Starbucks. I mean, if it's making it up, that's probably like, normally Chachi. BT wouldn't do this. Yeah, I'm doing. If it's, like, making up some of the transactions. Yeah. Because maybe you just went to Starbucks like, twice. 
Yeah, I definitely remember going to Starbucks, like, twice. 
Yeah, I only went to Starbucks, like, twice on here, so I think it's just picking that up, I guess. 
Yeah. My. Might be the way that it's reading the PDF. Yeah. Not a PDF. 
I'm probably confusing. 
Okay. 
Yeah, no worries. So I think coffee is more like 20 bucks than it is 100 bucks. Yeah. In that case, then, like, maybe coffee. Like how, like, you're. I'm sure, like, you feel differently about coffee than if it was just twice. 
Exactly. 
Yeah. So besides that, like, would you say there's anywhere that you would, like, want to look into more? You're like, you know what? 
Like, I'm. 
I'm pretty proud of myself for how I spent this month. 
Oh, yeah. 
I think I'm pretty proud of. 
I. 
Guess, like, the utilities and the bills this month. It's like, a pretty low amount, so I'm proud of that, I guess. Yeah. 
That's good. 
Maybe my health and fitness. I'm proud of that number, too. 
From, like, the, I guess, the angle of, like, investing in your health. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. Because I think I would pay for, like, vitamins and gym memberships, little things like that. 
Cool. 
And anything else come to mind as you're looking through this, or is it, I guess, pretty straightforward as you're looking at it? 
Yeah, everything's pretty straightforward. I think it does a good job at just kind of like, breaking down everything, which is good. 
Yeah, it's pretty straightforward. Yeah, definitely. I like it. 
Is there anything else you want me to ask or you think it's. It's pretty good? 
Yeah, I think. I think it's pretty good. 
Yeah. 
Perfect. 
Yeah. 
I think you did a great job. 
Yeah. You can always use this prompt. It's. It's free. You can. I think GPT is being weird, but you can always try and different apps to just give you breakdowns. But, yeah, that's really it. Like, I think we didn't need the full time, but I think this is. Yeah, this is good. 
Oh, right. Thank you. This is amazing. 
Yeah, everything. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Can always use this in the future. 
Great. 
Thank you so much. Well, I wish you, like, good luck with your app and everything, and I. 
Just hope this is successful. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Well, thank you so much. Have a good night. 
Yeah, you too. 
All right. 
Bye. Bye.
