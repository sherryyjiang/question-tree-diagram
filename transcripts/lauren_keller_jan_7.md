Hey, Lauren. Hi there. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:09
How's it going? 
L
Lauren Keller
00:10
I'm pretty good. How are you doing? 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:13
Well, I hope you had a great new year. 
L
Lauren Keller
00:17
Yeah, I did. It was, it was nice. So, yeah, crazy in 2026 already, so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:22
I know, right? Time, time totally flies. 
L
Lauren Keller
00:25
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:28
Awesome. So just a quick introduction. I'm Sherry, this is Jeff. And we're doing research for a company called Peak. Basically we're trying to understand how people who are just a few years after graduation, years after graduating college, are making adult decisions like, you know, financial ones. And purpose of this interview is to get to know you a little bit better and how you kind of think about these decisions. And then we'll also have some apps to have you kind of go through and use so you get some feedback. 
J
Jeff Min
01:03
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:05
Any questions before we get started? 
L
Lauren Keller
01:08
I don't think so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:10
Okay, awesome. So I'll start out with a question. Just tell us a little bit more about yourself. So age, when you graduated, what you're doing now, where you live. So all those kind of basics. 
L
Lauren Keller
01:22
Yeah, definitely. So I'm 23. I graduated, I guess a little bit over a year and a half ago now. I graduated college in May of 2024. I currently live in Quincy, Illinois. It's kind of like a. It's like a maybe mid sized town in western Illinois and I do work full time. I'm currently a customer support specialist at a division of a fairly major company. So that's I guess a little bit about me and what I've been doing recently. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:56
Got it, got it. And where are you from? Are you from Illinois or you moved. 
L
Lauren Keller
02:02
There like afterwards for a job? Yeah, sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off there, but I'm from Missouri originally, so not too far away because I mean the town I live in now shares a border with Missouri, so I helped towns like an hour away. But just, yeah, I was able to get a good job here. Just better opportunities than my hometown. It's really small and it's not too far, so I'm still able to visit a good amount. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:28
Got it. That's, that's great. And what was it like, I guess a year and a half ago, making the move to your new city or new town and starting your job? 
L
Lauren Keller
02:41
Yeah, I mean, definitely, I guess a little bit scary. A little bit, I guess like anxiety inducing, you could say. Just because I felt like I was, I mean I was happy to have a job. I feel lucky to have a good job offer. But I feel like just, I don't know, I guess moving away from the college town and like, all my friends, like, people that I knew the most. And I feel like really striking it out on my own versus, you know, being in college and still kind of like being around lots of close friends and still having, like, a lot more parental support definitely made it a bit intimidating along with like, you know, having to. 
L
Lauren Keller
03:17
Yeah, again, like, move to my own place and then adjust to, like, working full time as well and just getting used to that schedule. For sure. Yeah. Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:29
So I guess after you decide to make the move, like, what was it like to, I guess, make your first big money decision? Like, walk me through what that was. 
L
Lauren Keller
03:39
I guess probably it's my first one would probably be my car that I have now, which I know I bought a car before, but the one I got this go around was a little bit more expensive and I feel like, kind of like, I guess one of my first, like, full adult decisions. So I'd had my previous car for a little bit and I kind of wanted to upgrade, just make sure that I had something reliable that was going to last me for hopefully years. So I just kind of did some shopping around online, really, with some help from family members, and we found a dealer that looked good and went there and they were able to help assist. 
L
Lauren Keller
04:24
So, yeah, I mean, as far as, I guess the budgeting standpoint, I luckily had my car that I was able to trade in and still get some money from that and then had a little bit saved up from, like, college jobs, that sort of thing that I could put as an additional down payment and then obviously have a, like, monthly car loan. Got it. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:50
And you mentioned that you had, like, you know, family, like, help assist a little bit on the decision when it comes to like, figuring out, I guess, like, budgeting how much to spend on stuff, like, more broadly. Where have you been getting your, I guess, like, inspiration or influence? 
L
Lauren Keller
05:14
I guess I don't know, a little bit from, like, things that I see online. But I don't know. That's for something that I kind of want to get a little bit better at is actually tracking how much that I am spending. I mean, luckily, like, I'm in a position where I don't have to, like, totally pinch pennies, but still want to make sure I'm saving and then paying down a little bit of, like, credit card debt that I have. So I would like to get better at tracking, like, how much I am, like, actually spending. So that way I can, you know, just kind of have better habits overall. So I feel like I Just, I don't know. I mean, I know how much I have in bills every month, but I feel like I would like to try to track the More. 
L
Lauren Keller
05:58
What's the word? I guess, like, fun stuff a little bit more. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:03
Yeah, yeah. 
L
Lauren Keller
06:04
Expenses, that sort of thing. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:07
So I guess if you were to think about, you know, your fun spend and areas that, like, you would like to be a little bit more aware of, like, what would those be for you? 
L
Lauren Keller
06:20
I would say, I mean, my top ones would definitely be like, eating out, like, getting takeout, that sort of thing. I feel like that's way too easy to do. Just grab takeout for whether that's like, at lunch or for dinner, you know, and you don't want to cook. That's something that I do a little bit more than I would like to. And then probably, I guess just shopping in general. Probably, I guess especially like clothes shopping. Like, that's something I do a little bit too much of, probably when I don't necessarily need to. So those would definitely be my two biggest. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:54
Gotcha. Gotcha. And when you're like, I guess getting, like, food when you're eating out, are most of those times, like, I guess, getting stuff for yourself or is it like going to, like, a restaurant, like, with a friend? 
L
Lauren Keller
07:10
I would say probably the bigger portion is just like, grabbing something for myself. Yeah. During, like, lunch hour. But yeah, I mean, sometimes it's like definitely going to a restaurant as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:21
Okay, Gotcha. Gotcha. And when you said something like, I do it a little bit too much, like, what made you feel that way? 
L
Lauren Keller
07:32
I don't know. I guess I feel like. I don't know. There's not really, like, anything in, like, particular, I guess, just honestly, like, my family didn't, like, eat out like, a whole lot. Like, when I was younger, my mom and sometimes my dad, too, cooked a lot, like, most of the meals. So, like, I don't know, I guess just kind of like more so like, used to like that, like standard or like expectations. So just kind of like, I don't know, like, maybe I'm getting it like, a little bit too often. And then also from like, the health standpoint, too, a lot of, like, restaurants where you know, get taken out and maybe aren't necessarily the most healthy. There are luckily some healthier options out there that I try to, like, incorporate in. 
L
Lauren Keller
08:14
But yeah, I guess probably the majority just like, what I was used to when I was younger and then also, like, the health aspect too, a little bit. A little bit of money, too. But honestly, that's why I do, like, kind of why I do things like such as this, to get a little bit of, like, extra spending money so I don't feel bad eating out so much. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:34
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. That makes a lot of sense. And then I guess when you think about, like, what you're spending on shopping, right? What if you, like, think back maybe like, recently in, like, the last month, what were some purchases that you felt like you made that you didn't think, like, looking back, were quite worth it? 
L
Lauren Keller
08:58
Yeah. I would say in the past month, probably not as much. I think I have been getting better at this anyways. But it was, like, more holiday spending. I did get, I think, like, Black Friday, you know, when there's all the sales and stuff. I did get a couple of sweaters, and then I kind of ended up later on, I was like, these are, like, kind of similar. Like, kind of similar to each other and similar to things that I already have. So I think, you know, just keeping better inventory of things that I have would help with that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:30
Got it. So it's like you're out shopping, you see something that you like, you buy it in the moment, but then you go back and you're like, oh, wait, these all are kind of doing the same thing. 
L
Lauren Keller
09:39
Yeah, exactly. And I'm like, I kind of have something that, like, already fulfills this purpose. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:44
Yeah, got it. And in the moment, like, what was the. I guess the biggest. 
L
Lauren Keller
09:50
Like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:53
What were you thinking right before you wanted to go get it? 
L
Lauren Keller
09:58
Do you mean more so, like, at the store, like, before going. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:01
Yeah, at this. Yeah, let's just. 
L
Lauren Keller
10:03
At the store. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:04
Yeah. 
L
Lauren Keller
10:05
Okay. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I just feel like I like clothes a lot, and I feel like buying clothes is, like, fun, honestly. I mean. Yeah. I guess that, like, sense of, like, gratification or, like, satisfaction that comes from buying something. Honestly, especially, like, if you see, like, something that you like just kind of, I guess maybe a little bit of impulse, like, you don't necessarily, like. I don't know. I don't necessarily stop and think a whole lot about things that I already have. Especially, you know, if the price isn't, like, too significant. You know, I just think, oh, well, it's some. Here, so I'll buy it. You know, like, it's fun to buy something. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:41
Yeah, yeah. And then when you say, like, something that you like, is it, like, a style or color or, like, something you've been seeing for a while that you want to get? 
L
Lauren Keller
10:52
Yeah, I Would say a little bit of both. I mean, depending on the item, I guess in this most particular one, it was like, more so, like, color that has been more popular. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:05
Okay, got. And you're like, I wanna. 
L
Lauren Keller
11:08
Yes. And I'm like, yeah, I like this color. Like, this color's been everywhere, so might as well go ahead and get it. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:18
And then now, like, I guess thinking, like, before you're in the store, right, like, before you go shopping, like, why do you usually have in mind, like, I guess in this particular case, like, did you have in mind what you. 
L
Lauren Keller
11:30
Were going to get in this particular case? No, I just knew that I wanted to shop for some things, you know, see or had a good deal and just see what was there. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:42
Gotcha. Got. Got it. So you said that you also wanted to see what was a good deal. Was that also something that was motivating for that purchase? Like, you said that it was like you liked how it looked, the color, but was it also something that had a good deal happening as well? 
L
Lauren Keller
11:59
Yeah, definitely. With, like, Black Friday sales and just kind of like pre holiday type sales, I feel like that's definitely a big motivator too. If the price is, you know, less than what it would normally be, or if it just, like, seems like a good deal, that's definitely an incentive that pushes me to buy, too. More so than, you know, if I saw it and if it were full price, is it something that I would get? Maybe, or maybe not. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:25
Gotcha. Now, let's think about maybe the last time you bought something that you felt like was a great purchase, that you felt good about it in the moment. And afterwards you're like, I'm glad I got it. What would one of those be for you? 
L
Lauren Keller
12:41
I would say the one that I got bins a few months ago, but finally got a pair of the Birkenstock Boston clogs. But, like, they've been kind of, like, kind of trendy, like, for a little while. And I don't know, I would just say I, like, definitely follow the trends, but I'm kind of the type. I don't like to give in, like, right away. I like to, like, wait a little bit and see, like, how long it kind of sticks around. But, yeah, I mean, they've been around for a bit and I was like, I need, like, a different pair of shoes. So I ended up buying them. And, I mean, it was a great decision. They're really comfy and I've already worn them a lot, so I feel like it kind of Justifies, like, the price. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:23
Got it. Got it. So basically, if you feel like it's like, it's comfortable, it's something you wear often, and it's not something you already, I guess, have in your closet, that's what, like, worth it means to you? In this case? 
L
Lauren Keller
13:41
Yes, I think so. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:43
And how long did you wait around, like, observing the trend before you did, making a decision to buy? 
L
Lauren Keller
13:50
Oh, gosh, I would say, let's say maybe, like, probably like, at least a month, maybe two months before I, like, sort of, like, seriously considered buying. And then probably, like, total. I would say even longer. Maybe, like four or five months when I, like, kind of tossed around the idea, but probably, like, yeah, like a month or two of, like, seriously considering and kind of, like doing research on, like, where to buy them from and, like, what color to buy. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:16
Got it. And then I guess taking a step back, when you look at, like, how you made a decision to buy the sweater and then how you made a decision to buy the Birkenstock, like, how often do you find yourself, like, being more, like, research driven, deliver it before you buy something versus, like, hey, I just want to buy something, and then you just get it in the moment. 
L
Lauren Keller
14:38
Yeah, I would say. I know as I've gotten older in general, I've definitely gotten better about taking the time to research, but I would still like to get a little bit better. But I would say for me, probably a lot of it honestly depends on the price point. If it's like a item that's like $50 or less, like, I'll maybe think about it for a little bit. Like, especially if it's something online versus, like, being in the moment in a store. But, you know, it's something like that where I'm like, okay, I can just grab it, like, it's not gonna matter that much. 
L
Lauren Keller
15:13
But if, you know, if it's something, like, more expensive than that, particularly when you get to, like, over $100, that's when I definitely take the time to really consider as, you know, if, like, if I do that too many times, that can definitely have a major effect. Got it. Got it. That. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:29
That makes sense. So it's kind of like if it's less than 50, you're like, you know what? Like, I can just go get it. Yeah, but I guess Birkenstocks are, like, a little bit more expensive than maybe. 
L
Lauren Keller
15:39
Like, a single sweater. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:41
And. And you said something about, like, how your, like, decision is different between, like, online and in store. 
L
Lauren Keller
15:52
Yeah, I would say definitely a little Bit I feel like if it's online, I feel like I usually take a little bit more time to look because I mean, obviously things sell out there and I ran into that a few times. But you're like, you can like go back and you know, maybe even think about it for a couple of days and you're still able to kind of like easily go back to the app or website, whatever and get it. So I feel like that really allows for more time, I mean, versus if you're like in the store, like especially if you're like traveling and not somewhere like local to you, like you have to get it like pretty much right then, you know, at least within the same shopping trip. 
L
Lauren Keller
16:28
And even then like if you are local, you may not want to go back there. So it's kind of something you have to like decide right then. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:35
Yeah, gotcha. And in I guess in the case of like your birkinsuff, did you buy those online versus in store? 
L
Lauren Keller
16:45
Yes, I did buy those online. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:47
Okay, gotcha. And do you have like any like typical place you go shopping online more regular than others? 
L
Lauren Keller
16:59
I mean, honestly, there's quite a few places that I do look online. I would say probably some of my biggest ones at least that are like, more like chains would probably be like Aryan American Eagle and Abercrombie. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:11
Okay, gotcha. Do you do much on like Amazon or like Tick Tock or not? Not as much. 
J
Jeff Min
17:21
You go? 
L
Lauren Keller
17:21
Oh, I definitely do. Like, I do Amazon a fair amount and I, I browse on Tick Tock a lot. I don't really like buy from there, but I definitely like look at stuff and I'm just like active on there in general. But yeah, I definitely do both of those particularly Amazon for the buying. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:39
Oh, okay. What do you, what do you buy on Amazon? 
L
Lauren Keller
17:44
Kind of varies. I would say definitely like a lot of kind of like home type items. Like you know, recently I bought like a coat rack and like a hat rack just for like organizing. So yeah, a lot of home items, like occasionally like clothes, sometimes like electronic type stuff. Like I bought like AirPods on there a couple times and like a Kindle before. So yeah, I would say Amazon. Yeah. I mean there's a huge variety of stuff on Amazon and I buy from a fairly wide range on there. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:19
If you have to buy like home stuff or like necessities because you know, life happens. Like do you tend to go on Amazon versus like I guess going to a store in person? 
L
Lauren Keller
18:30
It depends, I guess on like what the item is probably like for more like necessities that I like. Just think of that. Like, I, like, need like pretty quickly. I would just like run to my Target or maybe Walmart. I can, like, think ahead more. I sometimes do, like, stuff from Amazon. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:45
Oh, okay, got it. So, like, things that you need urgently. 
L
Lauren Keller
18:47
Like, you just. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:49
Because you could just go. 
L
Lauren Keller
18:50
Right away. Yeah, right away. But yeah, like I said, if I'm able to, like, plan ahead with things more, I will do that on Amazon sometimes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:59
Gotcha. 
L
Lauren Keller
19:02
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:04
That's it. In terms of the. The first part with questions, Jeff, anything you would like to ask Lauren? 
J
Jeff Min
19:12
Nope. 
L
Lauren Keller
19:13
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:15
All right, then we'll move to the second part. Over to you, Jeff. 
J
Jeff Min
19:22
Let me paste you a link. I'm assuming you're on the laptop. 
L
Lauren Keller
19:29
Yep, I am. 
J
Jeff Min
19:32
Yeah. Just click open on the link and then if you don't mind sharing screen, that would be great. 
L
Lauren Keller
19:39
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
19:41
And then I'll walk you through the demo. 
L
Lauren Keller
19:44
Okay, sounds good. Let me make sure. I'm going to get it pulled up here. Okay. I think I've pretty much got it up. Okay. Can you see it now? 
J
Jeff Min
20:11
Slowing up? 
L
Lauren Keller
20:13
Yeah. 
J
Jeff Min
20:15
Can you refresh the page? It seems like the page didn't. 
L
Lauren Keller
20:18
Yeah, some of the, like, graphics weren't. I'll try refreshing. 
J
Jeff Min
20:28
That's. Yep. Let me check on my end to make sure that it's all correct. 
L
Lauren Keller
20:33
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
20:38
That's weird. I couldn't see it. Okay, you know what? That's fine. Would you like to log in with Google? 
L
Lauren Keller
20:47
Sure. Let me see. I'll give it. 
J
Jeff Min
20:49
There it is. You will not be required to upload anything. We're going to be using fake demo data, so it will not be your data per se, but it will be close to the full experience of what we'll see. 
L
Lauren Keller
21:03
Sounds good. You want me to go ahead and use my Google? 
J
Jeff Min
21:06
Yeah, yeah. Use any email account from Google. That would be the simplest way. I hope the graphics show up, though. 
L
Lauren Keller
21:16
Hopefully. I don't know. Worked fine and everything. It's just for some reason the picture wasn't fully loading. 
J
Jeff Min
21:25
Just to make sure, I'm also loading up on my end. So together. Which browser are you using? 
L
Lauren Keller
21:40
I'm in Chrome. 
J
Jeff Min
21:41
Okay. 
L
Lauren Keller
21:43
Looks like it's getting there. 
J
Jeff Min
21:47
Yes. 
L
Lauren Keller
21:48
Great. 
J
Jeff Min
21:49
Okay, cool. It seems like. Can you click on your profile photo on the top? Right. I just want to make sure that everything is working. Yeah. 
L
Lauren Keller
21:57
Great. 
J
Jeff Min
21:57
Okay. Things should be working. So let's click on, start exploring. That will basically import all those demo data into your account. 
L
Lauren Keller
22:05
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
22:07
I'll just take a few seconds. So while we're waiting for that, I'll just walk you through well how this process will go. So we're basically trying to build up a new version of our application based on a bunch of different research, interviews, etc. What will be the most helpful is if you could just basically, as you're using the app, if you could just say it out loud on whatever that comes to your mind about the experience, about what you think, about how you think the app is working, what doesn't work for you, etc. That'll be great. Me and Sherry, we're going to be putting ourselves on mute for a majority part of the application, but feel free to also ask for help if you need. But otherwise, just say anything you want. There's no right or wrong answer. 
J
Jeff Min
23:01
You don't need to worry about hurting our feelings or whatsoever. The whole point is to capture as much as possible on like the user journey of going through the app. Sounds good. 
L
Lauren Keller
23:11
Okay. Yeah, sounds good. 
J
Jeff Min
23:15
Now I'm going to actually, before that, any questions before I put myself into mute? 
L
Lauren Keller
23:20
I guess I just start clicking around and then say whatever comes to mind. Right, Exactly. 
J
Jeff Min
23:25
It's as simple as that. 
L
Lauren Keller
23:27
Okay, perfect. Sounds good. 
J
Jeff Min
23:31
All right, I'm going to be on mute then. 
L
Lauren Keller
23:34
Okay, so let's see. It talks about no spreadsheets and no pie charts. Things interesting too, that it says it doesn't care how much you spend, only what the spinning says about you. So it's a little bit more intuitive, I guess, than normal budgeting apps and can kind of maybe understand, I guess, you as a person, like a little bit more than a typical budgeting app would be, rather than just, you know, having like a basic graph. So I think that's definitely interesting. Keep going. Okay. Yeah, so it says. Okay, that's interesting. So, yes. Is your trans. More like the story of your transactions? So maybe it kind of gets to understand, kind of like you and your habits and it's a little bit more about, I guess, like you are as a person. Yeah. 
L
Lauren Keller
24:31
And this is like, this is an interesting kind of tidbit here too, where it says like, money isn't just money. It's a diary you've been writing without realizing. And I think that's definitely an interesting perspective because I feel like just kind of think as money is something, you know, that we need to have to buy the things we need instead of. It really does. I just kind of tell a story, really, I guess, where you've been and what you like to do and just really the kind of person you are. So I think these are cool. So Far, these little blurbs have definitely been helpful in understanding the app. Excuse me. So let's see. It says, notices patterns in your transactions and ask you questions about them. So. Huh. Yeah, that's interesting. We're kind of like. 
L

I don't know, I guess just really, like, gets to know you, honestly. So I guess I'm kind of curious and maybe we'll get. Get to this, but kind of curious about what. I guess more so it does with this information. Like, if it's just, like, for you to, you know a little bit more about yourself and understand your habits or if there's maybe it points to a larger goal. So these are definitely curious about that. Some interesting insights there then. Okay. It has, like, a little, like, scrapbook too, so that's cool, because I feel like scrapbooking kind of used to be trendy and, like, nobody really seems to do that anymore, so kind of fun to have a virtual version of that. So let's see what we have, Maybe. Okay, there we go. Okay, scroll around a little bit first. 
L
Lauren Keller
26:21
Kind of get the gist of the whole thing. Thing. So it goes. I guess that's like an overall what you spent in the week, then it goes through your weeks. Oh, I guess that pops up too. I want to track your spinning week by week too. Okay. So, like, that is the majority of it. Okay. So we'll focus, I guess, on the top part first. So I think this is helpful that it tracks what you have spent in the week and then also compares it to how you're doing towards the last week. So, yeah, I mean, I feel like comparisons are always helpful to have, especially if you're maybe trying to spend maybe less or just stay at a certain target. So. Oh, these are cool. 
L
Lauren Keller
27:17
You can kind of, like, categorize things, but I guess it pops up with your most recent transactions, and then it can tell, like, it's like your first time somewhere, and they just kind of track. Yeah. So I guess this kind of fits into what was talking about more with the clothes, whether that being, like, planned or an impulse. So I wonder now if I can click it. Magnets. Excuse me. Sorry, Sorry. I'm gonna mute myself for, like, a few seconds and grab some water. 
J
Jeff Min
28:12
No, no worries. No worries. 
L
Lauren Keller
28:14
Thank you. Okay. Sorry about that. I think hopefully I'm better now. I had a cold earlier last week, and I thought it was better, but I guess I triggered my cough again. Okay, so looks like it's kind of telling a story here, I guess, about your coffee experience. So looks like you have, like, A little conversation back and forth. And then you get to add, like, these little magnets or stickers, which are cute and definitely seem like it would be fun to kind of collect and wonder if there's like, a spot on your profile where you keep them. Oh, I guess they go. They go on the scrapbooks. So I think that's like kind of a nice little souvenir to help you remember, like, what you did and who you did it with. 
L
Lauren Keller
29:53
So I guess it's cool too, how you can talk to it and honestly have like, a full, like, conversation back and forth. So let's see if I'll talk a little bit here. Okay, so there's like, little, like, sticky notes here too, that automatically adds just kind of from based on what you say. Say. This is fun. Kind of talking back and forth here. I feel like it's pretty good at actually, like, conversating and making this feel, like, more natural. Okay, so they had a friend pop up too. So. See if we get any more badges here. Okay. It looks like it still says F for friend. Okay, Maybe we'll look at something else now so we have that marked. Let's see here. Maybe we'll try one more and see what this does. We'll say, went to the coffee kitchen. 
L
Lauren Keller
32:40
Maybe that's more of a ritual really, like going to this coffee place. They're prints, very high quality, and they have lots of interested flavors you can find anywhere. Nope, got another badge here. Co workers. These little badges are really fun, especially I really like a little, like, coffee cup, like the little emojis. I feel like it's super fun and gives you. It's kind of a good way to remember something that otherwise might kind of seem like a little bit mundane and part of the routine. But I feel like something like that maybe makes it just a little bit more exciting and gives you, like, an additional way to kind of like, look forward to that coffee run. So let's see. Look through a couple of things there. Let's look through the scrapbooks a little bit more. You can scroll through these first. 
L
Lauren Keller
34:24
See, so they go pretty far back and they also track the spinning as well. So I think that's really helpful maybe if you're trying to, I guess, just like, add up how much you've spent, like in a month or something. Or rather if you just want to track, like, the spending week per week. So maybe we'll look at the most recent one, especially this one has a lot of stickers too. So click on this and see what there is to look at. So we get magnets here. Okay. I think the coffee cup I saw earlier thought this was super fun. I like how it mentions too how often you've been, how much you spent. It also explains to you why it's there as well. 
L
Lauren Keller
35:17
And it doesn't just like, you know, put it there and kind of leave you wondering what that is even doing there. And then. Okay. And you can also remove it too. So that's nice. If you feel like that's not really you and you wouldn't want that to I guess kind of display you can easily remove it so you're not stuck with it and then you can have your go to places. So I guess if you have like multiple coffee places that you like to go, you can add them here. So this was the. One of the favorites that found coffee kitchen. Okay. And this gives you like kind of like a full like tracking of how often you've been there. So you can see like kind of outlets maybe become consistent. Consistent. 
L
Lauren Keller
36:04
So that's like a good way to know maybe what days more so you're going or I guess just to kind of look back and you know, remember, maybe reminisce on those coffee visits perhaps especially if there's maybe a meet up with a friend or a date or something like that. So let's see. Looks like there's Starbucks added here, but I don't think there's anything under it. Okay. And these are actually, I think some of the ones that I added that pop up here and show some of your friends that you I guess have done things with in that week and then adds preferences. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:54
Oh. 
L
Lauren Keller
36:54
And then it does a transactions week by week and does like a running total as well. So it's kind of helpful to know what you spent in a day as well because I feel like there's. I know for me personally there's like some days I try to like do like a no spin, like not spend anything. So I think it would be good to see all in one place kind of like if I'm staying true to that and then maybe to see if there's a day of the week especially that I tend to like splurge a little bit more. I think that would be an interesting insight as well. So yeah, overall it's just really fun. I do, I like these magnets a lot. I feel like that's something unique that I haven't really seen anywhere else. 
L
Lauren Keller
37:36
And I also like how it like categorizes things too. Like kind of what you did in a week, like this week it looks like you got coffee a lot and then also spent a lot on clothes. So even this is though, this isn't me. That seems kind of really true to me. So a little bit further and maybe we'll explore one more of these. Let's see. Look at this one. Looks like didn't get any magnets this time, but that's okay. And see that used Venmo a lot. So it looks like maybe spent a lot of time, even went on a little trip with friends or just spent a lot of time like hanging out with friends or something like that. I didn't track any people and then. See kind of able to do the same thing here. 
L
Lauren Keller
38:40
Track over much you're spending in a day. Yeah, I like this. This one a lot. I feel like it's easier to look at this day by day. A lot more so than it is in my banking app where you kind of have to, you know, scroll through. Either scroll through a bunch of transactions or kind of deal with some filters that might not be exactly friendly or easy to use. That was nice. A little bit more. So it's like these are all fairly similar here. It's kind of the same. Week by week we've looked through those kind of chatted. Hey, look. See the ask feature? Okay, so I guess this is like where you can just chat kind of more freely instead of like a like specific transaction. I guess I'm trying to think of something to ask. Say. 
L
Lauren Keller
39:59
Spent on coffee this past month. Okay. So it tells us that we spent 4550 on coffee. So I was impressed with how quickly it ran that was able to give me an exact number. And then I guess further prompts the conversation of saying how does that feel to you? Say not too bad. A lot worse. Off as a small treat, a picture routine. Does it feel like wanting a little boost or sexual polish for me, definitely more of a. Says there. And this is that 24 coffee was frequently. Interesting because it says there's only one coffee entry. But up here it says we spent 45 5. So not sure on that. But let's see. Here. Okay. And it like adds the chat too. So I guess we can go. 
L
Lauren Keller
42:10
I'm not sure if we can go back to it, but I guess we can track it or possibly look more into it, see what that says. 
J
Jeff Min
42:21
Sorry, it will break. 
L
Lauren Keller
42:24
Sorry about that. 
J
Jeff Min
42:27
No, no, you can just refresh. 
L
Lauren Keller
42:30
Okay. 
J
Jeff Min
42:31
But pretend that you're able to go back. Is actually. Is being able to go back important to you? Do you see yourself revisiting these conversations. 
L
Lauren Keller
42:42
I think it would definitely be something that could be helpful, especially if it's something that I kind of wanted to, I guess like track or like keep an eye on, like something like that or maybe, you know, just curious how much I spend in coffee in a month. So I think that would be something that nice to have for sure. Maybe not like absolutely necessary, but for sure helpful. Okay, so we've looked through most of that. 
J
Jeff Min
43:11
Oh, this just goes back to. I think we've actually got. 
L
Lauren Keller
43:16
Pretty much everything. I was just clicking on something that I had at looked at yet, so I think I've been through all the general categories anyways. 
J
Jeff Min
43:26
Yeah, we would then like to ask you a couple of questions as a follow up. The first question that I had was when you were going through, I suppose, the conversation experience, how did it make you feel? 
L
Lauren Keller
43:45
I mean, I thought it was fun overall. I mean, I think the like, I guess chatbot was very interactive and I feel like it kind of had like a friendly like welcoming tone. Definitely made it feel like kind of like you were talking to like a friend or someone who was like generally like genuinely interested versus just like a robot. 
J
Jeff Min
44:06
I see. Did you feel like it was asking too many questions or did you feel like, you know, it was like just being too chatty for the sake of being too chatty? 
L
Lauren Keller
44:19
I would say it was pretty good overall. Maybe there's a few like, maybe more towards like where you could kind of like normally you would be getting like more to like the end of like a natural conversation where it, like it like keep asking questions a couple times. I think the definitely some follow ups are good. I definitely like a few of those, but maybe not like quite as many. Especially if like after the conversation has taken like you know, maybe like four or five turns, something like that. Gotcha. Okay, let me just move it down. Yeah, I mean I think depending on what is said. Sorry to jump back in, but you know, sometimes obviously there's things that might like naturally prompt another question, but I don't think it's like exactly necessary maybe to ask one like every time. 
J
Jeff Min
45:09
Would you say that 405 is like your maximum for it feels or doesn't matter? 
L
Lauren Keller
45:16
Definitely not an absolute maximum, but probably more of a kind of like general guideline again. I mean I feel like every conversation is different and there's definitely some that would, you know, go on a little bit longer and maybe warrant more questions than others. But I feel like for a more like simple, straightforward conversation, like four or five turns would kind of be enough. 
J
Jeff Min
45:40
Got it. And how did it make you feel when you started seeing some things that popped up as, you know, you're going through this conversation? 
L
Lauren Keller
45:50
I would say, overall, I mean, it was kind of exciting just to see, like, what was going to pop up next. Like, I don't know if that exactly came from the conversation, but I really like the magnets especially. We could have, like, your own, like, little fridge, I think, like, week per week. I think the coffee was one of the ones that popped up, but definitely would like to see what other ones would be in store. And I felt like they're like, a fun, like, collectible way to, like, track your experiences, like, throughout the weeks and months. Got it. 
J
Jeff Min
46:25
You mentioned fridge, so how would you feel? So. So on. On the screen that you're looking at right now, you're seeing a bunch of different scrapbooks. Right. But you also mentioned another metaphor, which is a fridge. Do you have any preference between the 2? A scrapbook versus a fridge as a metaphor? 
L
Lauren Keller
46:46
I think I like the scrapbook because I feel like scrapbooking is, honestly, for me, kind of nostalgic because I feel like that's something that a lot of my, like, relatives used to do when I was younger, and I even had, like, my own little scrapbook. But I feel like people don't really do that anymore because everything is so digital. So I think it's fun to really kind of bring that into the digital world but still have, like, that fun kind of, like, collectible aspect. And it's also definitely, like, a way to express yourself as well. Just kind of, you know, have your interests there. 
J
Jeff Min
47:23
Sherry, do you have questions? 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:25
Yeah, I do. So, like, as you were, like, going through the chat. 
L
Lauren Keller
47:30
Right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:33
So the magnets, like, would pop up, like, in the middle of the conversation, I think for the coffee one. 
L
Lauren Keller
47:43
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:43
How would you feel between, like, it popping up when something interesting comes up just anywhere in the conversation? That's one approach or, like, you know, the other approach is that we get you to finish the conversation at its natural point and then you earn the magnet at the end. Like, which do you think would be more motivating for you? 
L
Lauren Keller
48:08
I don't know. I mean, I think. I think either or would be fun for me personally, because I probably don't have, like, a huge preference. I guess I would probably lean slightly more towards, though it popping up at, like, the end of the conversation, though. I feel like that's kind of more motivating to, like, finish out the conversation and then maybe also it could maybe kind of be seen as a little bit of like a surprise from that aspect. Like, and maybe it doesn't like even pop up at all there. You just like go to like, check your fridge and then like, this new magnet's there, like something like that. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:37
And then let's say for the things that are like, popping up in the chat, right, those like little post it notes, like, would you like to be able to go back and see where they came up after you're done with the chat? 
L
Lauren Keller
48:52
Yeah, I mean, I think that would definitely be nice. It'd be kind of fun to see like, I guess what exactly like, triggered them. And I guess just to have that like, history, like, I guess in case you really want to like, go back and just like reflect or reminisce. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:06
Gotcha. But I guess you would first and foremost like to be able to see your magnets, I guess, more easily. And then if you wanted to go deeper, then you can go somewhere in history to see the other, like, post its. 
L
Lauren Keller
49:20
Yeah, I would say something like that. The magnets would probably be like the more like primary focus for me and then would still be able to like, access the posts if I wanted to as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:29
Okay, got it. So basically you like how the post its would kind of get you closer to like the end of the conversation where you would earn the magnet. The magnet then in the scrapbook is like, kind of nice to hold, but if you wanted to go back to the post its, you could just do that in history. 
L
Lauren Keller
49:46
Yeah, I think that's a good way to put it. I think that the post its are kind of more so like your little, like, milestones or like your trackers throughout the conversation. And then getting the magnet is kind of like the end goal. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:55
The low price. Yeah. 
L
Lauren Keller
49:57
Yeah. Mm. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:03
Was there anything about the experience that you felt was confusing? 
L
Lauren Keller
50:09
Honestly, not really. I feel like it was pretty well designed. I mean, I think I was just able to, as someone who's like, fairly comfortable with like, technology and using new apps, I feel like I was just able to look at it and navigate through everything. It was all like, pretty clearly labeled on what everything was. And yeah, I mean, I don't think there was anything that was unclear at all for anyone who's, I guess, kind of used to, you know, using mobile apps. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:39
Got it. 
L
Lauren Keller
50:39
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:40
Was there anything that you were expecting that you wanted to see, but you didn't see or get in the app? 
L
Lauren Keller
50:49
I guess, like, I don't know from the start, I guess I thought there would be a Little bit more. Like, until, like, I read, like, the description and all that, which, honestly, I'm, like, pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be, like, a little bit more budget focused, but I think it's more so, like, you can, like, kind of like, I guess, like, choose the budget for it, but it's a lot more focused, like, kind of like. I guess I'm, like, more the intuitive side of things, like, focusing on kind of, like more like who you are as a person and like, the actual experience versus, like, just spending the money, which I think can, in turn could kind of like, help you budget as well if you're able to, like, reflect on the experience. Experience. 
L
Lauren Keller
51:22
So, yeah, I mean, I think it wasn't, I guess, from the start wasn't, like, fully what I was expecting, but definitely a pleasant surprise. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:32
And would you want to be able to, at some point, take this kind of information and do things that are more practical, like, change your budget? 
L
Lauren Keller
51:40
Yeah, I mean, I think that would be nice. Like, a nice thing to have. Like, maybe there's, like. I don't know, it could be where there would almost be, like, another, like, mode or something that you could enter. Maybe have, like, a more, I guess, like, practical or, like, serious mode where you could like, actually, like, put this into, like, a budget or, like, really, like, easily track it or, like, compare, like, week by week. So it'd be a nice feature to have that could be, like, probably added without, like, taking away from, you know, this aspect of it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:11
Got it. And is there anything that you felt like you didn't like when you were using this? 
L
Lauren Keller
52:21
I think, honestly, not really. I feel like everything that I used I thought was pretty nice. I would say. I know it's, like, still being worked on, but, yeah, I would say the chatbot probably maybe could use, like, a little fine tuning on some certain things. But overall, I thought, like, the tone of that was great. It was fun to talk to. Just, I mean, you know, some of the responses can maybe be a little bit, I guess, like, you know, with the, like, questions. And I think there was one where maybe, like, the response, like, didn't match up to what it said previously. But I know that's something that I'm sure, again, would be corrected. But, yeah, I mean, I think the features as a whole, I liked everything, and I thought they're pretty, like, different to things that I'm used to using. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:10
Mm, got it. And different in, like, a. A good way or a different. 
L
Lauren Keller
53:20
Yeah, definitely a good way. I would say more like, definitely, like a fun way, definitely. Again, like, not fully what I was expecting, but I think that's definitely a good thing. I think it kind of makes this a lot more fun. And I think, in turn, could kind of, like, make budgeting fun, too, when you're again, able to look at kind of, like when and, like, why you're spending the money. So maybe that can kind of help you, like, use, like, a, you know, a different lens for tracking it versus just using only the numbers alone and be a more, like, flexible way, honestly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:57
Awesome. That's all the questions I have. Jeff, anything? 
J
Jeff Min
54:02
No, I'm good. Thank you so much. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:04
Yeah, thank you so much for your time, Lauren. 
L
Lauren Keller
54:06
Yeah, no problem. This is. This is fun. Sorry about my coughing and all that. I don't know, I guess I just got to talking too much, and I just, like, got this, like, itch in my throat. 
J
Jeff Min
54:19
Appreciate it. Thank you so much. 
L
Lauren Keller
54:21
No problem. Thank you. Thank you. 
J
Jeff Min
54:23
Have a good night. 
L
Lauren Keller
54:24

Bye. Bye.
