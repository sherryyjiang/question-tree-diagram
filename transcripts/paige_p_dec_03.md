The meeting time because on the Thanksgiving I completely forgot that I had a gathering and I was like, oh my. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:05
Goodness, no, don't worry about it at all. I actually like should have actually blocked out that day because I had family stuff as well. And I didn't really realize because I was just. Yeah, wasn't on top of it. But it's totally fine, don't worry. I. I actually felt like it would be much nicer not doing it during a holiday day when you can spend it with like friends and family. So don't worry about it. 
P
Paige P
00:28
Thank you. I'm sorry. I just felt bad. I was like, oh my goodness, I can't believe I did that. And then I saw the message while I was sitting. Like I went upstairs to like go join and then I saw the message and it said about how we could change it and I was like, yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:41
Yeah, no worries at all. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:44
Awesome. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:45
Well, I'll like quickly like introduce myself and like how we'll spend the next like hour. But most of it is really just like getting to know you, but I'll just do my spiel. So. I'm Sherry and I'm doing search for a product called Peak. We're basically really interested in understanding people's like, relationship and behaviors when it comes to money and using that to like build a product that hopefully helps like let's create a more modern, I guess app around like money management. So yeah, I guess to just give a structure for like how this will go. So initially we'll spend time just like getting to know you. So I have some questions just like about your background, et cetera. And then I have a couple of, I guess app. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:31
We have an app as well as I have a, like a prototype, like basically a very mock up version of something. We're trying to like experiment with that. I'll show you just for your. 
P
Paige P
01:41
Yeah. Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:44
Two quick things to check with you before we start. One is, are you cool if we record this meeting for learning purposes? 
P
Paige P
01:50
Yes. You're doing research. I'm not going to say no whatsoever. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:53
Okay. I just always ask for consent just because like it's important. And second one is, are you comfortable with connecting your bank account to the app and then just showing me? 
P
Paige P
02:04
I already connected it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:05
Oh, okay, great. 
P
Paige P
02:07
I have it pulled up here. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:09
Okay. 
P
Paige P
02:09
I have it. I saw the message and like the gig information on home from college or something I saw and I was like, either this or if you have a bank statement. So I was like, I'm just going to connect to the app. So I am on the app. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:22
Oh, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:23
Got it. Okay, no problem then. 
P
Paige P
02:26
All good. Well, you're. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:27
You're already. You're already set up, so maybe we'll just get into like the. Yeah, just like the intro questions. Yeah, tell me about yourself. Like, where you live right now, like, what have you been up to, how long has it been, if you have graduated, etc. Just like all of that. 
P
Paige P
02:44
Okay. I'm from Jersey. I am in Nashville, Tennessee for school. I went to Vanderbilt for undergrad. I graduated in May, but now I'm back again from my master's program for nursing. So I'm going to be in nursing school the next three years. And I used to bowl in college, so, like, that's really. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:03
I'm not that exciting. 
P
Paige P
03:05
Like, I'm just studying all the time. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:08
Yeah, no worries. And I guess currently. So your masters are starting when? 
P
Paige P
03:14
It started in August. So I'm going to do. So I'm doing master's in nursing. I'll graduate next December, and then I'm going to continue so I could be a nurse practitioner for emergency and family care. So that's gonna be two additional years on top. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:28
Okay, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:30
And currently, like, what are. I guess what are you doing in between the time then? Because you graduated and I guess you're starting masters, like 20, 26. 
P
Paige P
03:41
I started them. I graduated undergrad in May. Like, I started my masters this past August. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:46
Oh, okay. Sorry, I. I misunderstood. I thought you said you were starting it next. Me, sorry, Next. Next August. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:55
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
03:55
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:56
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:56
Bowling in college is also. Sounds kind of fun. 
P
Paige P
03:58
I'm. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:58
I'm. I'm terrible at bowling, so. Matt. Respect. Yeah, well, I mean, since you're in school right now, like, I. I'm curious like, how you are, like doing, I guess, doing everything related to like, money management. 
P
Paige P
04:13
Currently I work ever. So I'm going home actually this Saturday. So, like, I work every break that I get. So, like, that's the month break.  I worked my butt off in the summer. I had like two to three jobs at some one point. And then at the end of it I was like, okay, I just need a break. And basically I just try not to spend money. I don't really look into it. Like, I'm just like, okay, if I. I haven't really shopped like I used to, I would consider myself a shopaholic, but I haven't really been doing that. And I think most of my money comes out from like, if I treat myself to like Chipotle every Now and then, or if I get myself a coffee or if we're doing studying with a coffee. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:55
Mm. 
P
Paige P
04:55
And then obviously with Christmas coming up, now it's Christmas gifts that I'm just first here, that I'm going to do the home from college stuff, try and make additional money. And then I got a job doing mobile bartending, so I'm going to try and do that whenever I have free time. So we're. We're all over the place with that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:12
Yeah, all good. So, like, if you don't mind me asking, like, right now, like, are you, like, are you supporting yourself through the income you're making during the off seasons, or is it, like, a bit of mix of both? 
P
Paige P
05:26
It's a mix of both. Like, my dad helps me, but I don't like to ask him for money. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:31
Yeah, gotcha. 
P
Paige P
05:32
I like making my own money and using my own money. And he's like, well, you know, if you needed it, you can ask. And his fiance loves giving, like, her kids, like, she will give them anything. And I'm just like, christine, you do not have to give me anything. Like, it's okay. Like, I can do it. It's fine. But, yeah, I wouldn't say I'm supporting myself in its entirety because my dad does help with rent, but other aspects. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:55
Yes. 
P
Paige P
05:56
Myself. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:56
Yeah, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:58
So basically, like, most, like, I guess the things that you spend that are, like, outside of the necessities of, like, okay, here's my rent, et cetera. Like, that's coming out of what you earn. 
P
Paige P
06:08
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:09
Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:11
Makes sense. And you said something interesting. You said that you used to be a shopaholic. I would love to, like, just hear more. Like, if you just can go back in time and, like, tell me more about, like, what your typical shopping was like and why you called it out as a. As a problem. I guess in a way, I view. 
P
Paige P
06:34
Retail therapy as actual therapy. So, like, if anything was happening or if I was stressed, I'd be like, okay, let's just go to Target and get, like, whatever. And then in high school, it was always, I wanted new clothes, and then I would just buy new clothes. So I would be making. Like, I should have more money saved than I do. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:53
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
06:53
And I recognize that it was from shopping. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:57
And how did you. I guess, did you look at a bank statement to, like, figure that out or what was the moment of reckoning? I guess. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:08
I don't even know. 
P
Paige P
07:09
I just, like, realized because I looked at my card one day, like, the balance, and I was just like, oof. It's like, yeah, no, that's not going to cut it next year. Because this was last year when I looked at it and I was like, oh, yeah, that's not good. So then it flipped a switch within the last. It almost coming up to a year. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:29
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:31
And so now do you do much shopping anymore? You've kind of, like, held off on it? 
P
Paige P
07:36
I really try and hold off on it. Unless I'm on like, Facebook Marketplace and there's something that's like a good deal or went to Plato's Closet for Black Friday and I bought three different things for like $40. That one item would usually cost $40. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:51
Yeah, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:53
So you'll like, opportunistically still buy it? 
P
Paige P
07:55
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:56
Okay. 
P
Paige P
07:56
But only if I think about it and I'm like, okay, well, how often am I going to use it? How often am I going to wear it? Like, what am I going to do with it? 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:03
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
08:05
I think through it more in the past. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:10
Like, maybe let's use Target as an example because it's easier. Like you said, you'll get whatever, right? Like, could you describe, like, what the range of things you got were? 
P
Paige P
08:23
I mean, Target has groceries. So, like, I could just go get groceries or I get clothes, or I'm like, oh, look at the shoes or the accessories, or if I, like, see a bin and I'm like, okay, I could use this in the room or I can use this at home. So the range could literally be from clothes to groceries to home accessories. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:42
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:43
And how much did you end up using? Some of the stuff you bought. 
P
Paige P
08:50
The one dress. I remember the one time I bought a dress and I was like, oh, I'm going to love this. I'll wear it. I've worn it. One time I bought like, this little plate thing for like, a home decoration that you could put on, like the door way by, like, on that. I forget what the heck it's called, but it's like what you put like your keys on. We literally have it, so there's no point in even having that. Yeah. So, nah, didn't really use much of it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:20
So you would say, like, basically you went to more like, satisfy like, more of an emotional need and you would just get stuff and then afterwards you're like, I didn't actually end up using much of it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:34
Correct. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:35
Okay, got it. Thank you for sharing, by the way. If you like, I guess, like, looking back then, like, were there other, like, I guess spending patterns or, like, habits that you Were like, oh, like, I need to, like, better about this. Or do you think, like, shopping was like, that main culprit? 
P
Paige P
09:56
I'm so much better when it comes to coffee now. I used to get Starbucks in high school. Whenever Covid was going on and everything was online, I went to Dunkin three times a day. And then while at college, I would go to Starbucks like, maybe one to two times a day or like, I'll do like five times in a week. And then I started realizing I'm like, I really should not be spending this much money on it. So then I asked for an espresso for Christmas, and then that helped. Other than this past year, I think I only really spend money on coffee if I'm going to study or if it's like, yesterday went. But I took an exam yesterday morning. I'm like, I deserve a coffee. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:36
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:37
Like, as an occasion, it became an occasional treat myself. 
P
Paige P
10:41
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:41
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:44
When you. When you used to get Duncan three times a day, like, this is during COVID Right. What was it mostly for? Like, were you trying to just leave the house or do you just like, was it boredom? Like, what was the. 
P
Paige P
10:59
Literally just leaving the house. Because I. The way that. I don't know. I know different high schools have, like, their block schedules, but, like, we had eight period schedules and I had two breaks throughout the day. And it's like, I don't want to just sit at home the entirety of it. So it would be like the one break. I would drive, go get coffee, and then come back, do some of the classes that I had to do. Then I would go out again, get another one, and then at the end of the day, I would go to the gym and then get a coffee on the way home. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:28
Okay. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:29
So it felt. It was a, I guess a bit of like a in between break where you treated yourself, essentially. 
P
Paige P
11:36
I really didn't need it. We literally had a Keurig in the house. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:41
And now you have a. You said you have an espresso. Espresso machine. 
P
Paige P
11:46
Used to. I used to have the Nespresso. Then it broke. So now my roommate lets me use her espresso machine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:51
Okay. 
P
Paige P
11:52
Which is so much cheaper. So it's like you just spend 15 on a bag of ground espresso and then you have it for two, three weeks. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:01
Yeah. And did you, like, notice any difference in quality of life after you switch or you're like, look, I didn't need to spend that money. 
P
Paige P
12:13
I'm not as nervous about looking at my bank account. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:16
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
12:18
If I'm being completely honest, because, like, I do have right now, I have, like, other loans. So, like, in total, I'm gonna have, like,140,000 after this year in loans. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:28
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
12:28
So it's like, I think also subconsciously I'm thinking about how much I'm gonna have to owe. And my bank account, I'm like, okay, well, even though I'm this much in debt, at least I have this amount that can, like, help me live. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:44
Makes sense. Got it. And then let's, like, now, like, go back to current day. Right. Do you think you're, like, you know, generally, like, much better at some of these areas, which is great. Do you think that there's any, like, other leaks or, like, habits that you feel like you still want to improve on 100%? 
P
Paige P
13:09
I mean, I have. I don't. I don't know if, like, this is, like, something that's, like, would ruin your research with information. I don't think it would be, but, like, I vape. So, like, that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:20
That's fine. 
P
Paige P
13:20
Is very costly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:22
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
13:23
Yeah. And I've tried to quit, and I'm just like, I don't need to right now. When I'm in school, I'm like, all right, I have enough stress. I'm not quitting while I'm in school right now. And then maybe in the winter. Yeah, that's definitely something that would be a lot better. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:38
Yeah. Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:41
What's stopping you from. I guess it's a. Yeah. What's stopping you today from just doing it? 
P
Paige P
13:48
The only thing, like, that I can think of right now as to, like, why I would stop is the money aspect of it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:55
Okay. 
P
Paige P
13:55
And I also, like, I'm learning about everything, about how bad it is for you, which, like, that's another factor in my head. But then at the same time, I'm like, I've just been doing it while I study for so long. I don't want to go through the withdrawal while also already being stressed. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:10
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:11
Do you know how much you're spending on vaping? 
P
Paige P
14:13
I could do quick math. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:19
Let's do an average. 
P
Paige P
14:29
Around, like, $1,050 a year. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:33
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:36
That was actually pretty quick math. 
P
Paige P
14:39
I put in the calculator. That's why I just did the average of, like, if I go to one. One shop and the other shop and made, like, the average of, like, what that amount would be and then multiplied it by the weeks. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:50
I guess. Like, how does that amount of money make you feel? Like, does it feel like, oh, it's not that bad. Or you're like, oh, that's actually quite. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:56
A bit that I. 
P
Paige P
14:58
For me, I hate it just because, like, I know that I like, you don't. No person needs to do that and spend that much money. So like any amount that I can save, I feel like is really important because whatever. But then whenever, like if I look at just that number, it doesn't seem like that much. But whenever I look at the amount of time that I've been doing it, then I'm just like, that is absurd. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:25
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
15:25
Because I think I would have had like maybe like $5,000 more in my bank account if that was not the case. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:36
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:40
So gotcha. And would you say, like your like biggest motivation to make sure, like your bank account is at a certain place is to make sure you can pay off student loans while like maintaining day to day life? Or is there another motivation, you think. 
P
Paige P
15:59
Right now for saving money? I think like my motivation is just I don't want to run out of money because I can't work like I used to. Yeah. Because like in college, like undergraduate school with the bowling team, like we're D1. So they would give us like our. When we would travel, we would get our. I forget the word. Our per diem so we could get like lunch and everything. So like that was like, oh, okay, like I'll get this amount. So at least like that's a little bit more. So if I did run out of money, but were traveling, like, it would be fine. And then were also among the few schools that received the Alston Award, which was like $5,000 at the end of the year. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:38
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
16:39
So like I had that part being like, okay, well like next year comes around, it's fine. And then now it's just like I'm thinking about it and I don't have my own steady income and I am also thinking about the fact that I will have loans and I can't keep doing that and live that way. I think also just maturing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:00
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:06
Got it. Okay, well, thank you for sharing that. 
P
Paige P
17:11
Sorry, a lot of information. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:12
No, no, this is, this is great. I appreciate like honesty and all of that. What we're going to do next is I'm going to just have you like now go onto the app because you already have it downloaded. What would be good is if you can share your screen on your app and I'll show you how you can do. Have you shared screen on your phone before on Google Meet. 
P
Paige P
17:40
I have not. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:43
I will show you how it works. I just unmasked. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:47
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:48
So if you go to the calendar. So here's our meeting. If you click on it, there is a Join Google Meet button. And then you press share screen. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:02
Oh, okay. 
P
Paige P
18:03
Beautiful. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:03
Yeah, Getting there. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:06
Make sure you have your volume turned all the way down on your phone and mute yourself. If you don't do it, there'll be this horrendous echo that goes. If you do that, it's fine. I'm just letting you know there'll be a horrendous echo and shriek. If that doesn't happen because of the. The way me is calibrated on the audio side. 
P
Paige P
18:24
Yeah, that would be terrible. I do have a question, though. When you do the research, my name wouldn't say about, like, vaping and such, right? Like, my, like, name wouldn't go with that, like, with research or anything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:37
I mean, it will be in the notes, but if you want to mask certain things, like, you can let me know. But nothing leaves the team. 
P
Paige P
18:42
Okay. All right. I just like the vaping parks. I didn't know if that was, like, a public. Like, if that would be, like, a public thing or whatever. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:48
No, no. Nothing. Oh, no, no. None of this is public. Just to be very clear about confidentiality, like, the only people looking at it. 
P
Paige P
18:56
Would be my team. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:58
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:59
Don't worry. I will not rat you out to your dad from a tech product research. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:06
Beautiful. Is this sharing? No, it's not sharing. Let's see. Oh, that's me. How do I. I clicked the share. 
P
Paige P
19:24
Screen thing and I guess it did not like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:30
Oh, what is. 
P
Paige P
19:31
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:43
Okay, so how this is going to work is kind of just pretend I'm not here and you're just going through the app just, like, as naturally as possible, and pretend you have a microphone to your head and you're just, like, saying whatever comes to your mind out loud like, oh, this is interesting. Oh, I don't know what this is. Oh, this confuses me. I don't like this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:08
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:08
Anything that comes to mind? 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:10
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
20:14
I just hate seeing how much I spend on the credit card with this one. I have no idea what this one is. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:30
You haven't seen this expense? 
P
Paige P
20:33
Yeah, I have no. I. I have no idea what that one is. It might have been from, like, a call flight or something, I would presume. I like this one. It says super quiet. Coffee. That was probably one of the more expensive coffees I've ever had. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:01
That's ridiculous. 
P
Paige P
21:10
Sounds about right. That's my daily or weekly groceries, Target. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:28
Yeah, hate. 
P
Paige P
21:34
Like, I like to click the buttons too with it because I'm just like, I like seeing, like, the amount that I spend at Target and it's actually like, every time it's less than 100, it makes me happy. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:51
That's shocking for me. Yeah. 
P
Paige P
22:16
I kind of like seeing all the different, like, amounts to show. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:23
That you like or you don't like. 
P
Paige P
22:26
I like seeing all of them. Like, even if it's, like, spending that I don't like to see, I like being able to see it all in the app because I don't like going on my bank statements. So, like, the fact that it, like, picks out certain things and it's like, well, this, and this makes it more noticeable than if I'm going on a bank statement. It's just like, blah looking, I guess. And like, I asked and, like, will tell you more about the certain things. I like that it can do this part too and ask about, like, the spending. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:33
When you mean by this part, you. 
P
Paige P
23:35
Mean, like, Yeah, I mean, like, whenever you go in and it's like the Tell me more. And it basically, you know, when you talk to certain AI and the AI doesn't really like to give you more information, it's like, oh, I can't help you with this. I like that it actually goes in depth and isn't like, oh, that's out of my reach, or I can't do this and stuff like that. And it actually asks for responses back and isn't just like, okay, this is that and that's it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:03
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:03
So you like the fact that it, like, helps you continue the conversation and dig in more. 
P
Paige P
24:08
Yes, because it's not like, all right, I'm just going to show you what I want to show you in a way. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:23
So you like the fact that it, like, asks you and kind of puts you in control in a way. 
P
Paige P
24:29
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:30
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:33
And when you said it doesn't feel like other, like, AIs, like, what's your comparison actually? Like, if you had an experience with another one where you're like, oh, man, this was not really useful. Like, which. Which comes to mind. 
P
Paige P
24:50
Well, I've done, like, sports betting and there's been problems with, like, bonus bets. So I would message them and they'd just be like, that is not in our. I think it's something along the lines, like, that is not in our capabilities. And then it's like, choose from this menu option. And then it gives you, like, a selection of options to choose from in a menu and then you click it and Then there's another set of options that chooses within that umbrella and those options don't always match up with that umbrella term that you chose. So then you have to start back up until you finally click the correct one and then it will bring you to a team member. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:28
Oh, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:28
So basically like you're comparing this to like, I guess like the customer service chat bots that you will see. 
P
Paige P
25:35
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:36
But you feel like, oh, this is not like super smart. And then at the end of the day I still have to talk to somebody and I just spend all this time talking to this bot and didn't. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:45
Get much out of it. 
P
Paige P
25:46
Yes. Because sometimes it takes like 20 minutes when you're trying to speak to a representative and then no one ever gets to the phone because the chat doesn't know that it wants to like that you want to do that unless you call. But then there's not always times that you're able to call. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:00
Yeah, yeah, makes sense. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:09
Yeah, continue. 
P
Paige P
26:21
I mean this like kind of just. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:22
Makes sense to me. 
P
Paige P
26:24
I don't even know what the hardware part is, but like 31 transactions at restaurants, low key, not my best, not my favorite. And then the rent my dad reimburses me for, like, that's not big for me. I don't even know what the hardware was. You have no idea what that is. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:59
How did you think about the response where it was like, hey, it was like a one off. So I mean basically it's saying it doesn't really matter as much as the stuff you do more regularly. 
P
Paige P
27:10
Yeah, I like that better because then it like doesn't make me feel as bad about it because like you're able to say like, okay, like I didn't really need that, but I know that I'm not going to use that again or like something like that. But I do also based off like me not really knowing what it was to begin with and it's saying the response being it was for a project. I think I like that because it's not just saying, okay, well it has to be for a project. That's the only option like that I think would be, I don't know, I just like seeing the quote unquote, I think because I really don't know. Yeah. What resonates with me because I really don't know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:49
Got it, got it. 
P
Paige P
27:56
I also like that it doesn't just do within the last like couple of months and you can go backwards in time. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:03
You like that how far back is meaningful for you? 
P
Paige P
28:07
Well, for me right now, I'm honestly just most concerned with like, I feel like six, like with August because that's whenever I started school. Like, I'd probably be then moving forward. I'd probably care more about like six month intervals because I feel like that's pretty on par with knowing where you're at with any like halfway point of a year because then you try to keep track of things. That is terrible. I did not know that I ate out more in October. And I like that the responses literally can read my thoughts because that is insane. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:59
I don't even know voice though. 
P
Paige P
29:14
Del. To generate challenge. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:20
I message it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:25
Yeah, just. Just write. I'm worried about that jump again. I'll. I'll explain the challenge trigger thing again. It's not necessarily working, but I'll explain the intent and see if it's. It would be useful for you. 
P
Paige P
29:40
Is that something that y' all just started doing, like the challenge thing? 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:44
Yeah, yeah, there's some bugs on it, but we are curious about what people would do with it if it worked. But I'm going to just take a look at. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:55
Oh, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:56
You just said I'll try it. Actually, at this point, like, what would feel natural to you? Right. You just saw. Actually you started out with something different. Let's go back to the top, if you don't mind. 
P
Paige P
30:14
Few. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:14
There were like a few conversations. 
P
Paige P
30:19
This one. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:22
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:22
Yeah. So you started out okay. You started out talking about this and then you moved on. Oh, sorry. I think this is like the complete chat history. Scroll down. What was my biggest spend? I remember, like when you triggered the first go up again. 
P
Paige P
30:41
Oh, I think I triggered it. This was the first one. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:44
Oh, this was the first one. Okay. 
P
Paige P
30:46
Yeah. And we just kept going because honestly, like, the more that I was saying I was more interested as it kept going. Okay. Because nine times out of ten, I wouldn't want to do a challenge. But the fact that it was like, oh, like I have this challenge for you just based off the amount that you spent. And I kind of like a challenge. So I like that it's offered. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:05
Got it. 
P
Paige P
31:05
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:06
Like, you basically, like would be more likely to take upon that challenge after you talk with the AI and it like got to understand you a bit better. And it's like, hey, based on what we've been talking about, I think this could work versus, like if it was just plopped like into the feed 100. 
P
Paige P
31:23
I mean, I do. Like also because with that conversation, like comparing the two different amounts for like the months, I think makes more sense to Try and do that challenge because it's like, all right, well, from point A to point B, you've jumped up this amount. Then if it was like, oh, you spent this much, do you want to try a challenge to reduce this cost for next month? Like, it's at least showing me, like, you were at like 13 different transactions. Now you're at 20 something transactions. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:50
Yeah, got it. So let's just say, like, you pressed. Hey, I would start the challenge right. Like, do you think it would actually, like, if we tracked it, like, on the app? Like, you can see how many. Let's say we have, like, eating out as like, a card category and it counts each time. Like, how would. How would that make you feel? 
P
Paige P
32:11
I don't know how it would make. I see, like, obviously, like, I was an athlete. Like, I like to win things. So, like, if there was something out of it, like, I would not mind it whatsoever, but I feel like I would feel badly about it if I was like, racking up continuously. Then if it was like, okay, like, your goal is less than 10. Like, if you get less than 10, like, it's just like, it's not even like winning something, but more so, like, something like, popping up. Like, it's like a sense of accomplishment, I feel like would be nice. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:43
Okay, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:44
So, like, even if it was like, let's say a small reduction, like, here's something to try or experiment. If you felt like you were working towards something like that, you would feel motivated from it. 
P
Paige P
32:54
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:56
Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:59
Another question, like, now that you've, like, gone through the process of, like, talking to the AI, this AI was, I would say, a little bit more informational. Like, it was like talking about numbers and stuff. There's also, like a mode where the AI is more reflective, meaning it gets you to reflect on more. Like, the value or importance of that spend. Which one would you prefer or do you like both, but just in different settings? 
P
Paige P
33:34
I like both in different settings, I think, because, like, for one, I know I spent like $340 last month on my computer because I had water damage, which I look like I have a backdrop on my computer. So, like, I feel like I would like the reflection on why for that more so than the informational aspect. But whenever it comes to coffees, groceries, restaurants, like, I would like the informational to be like, okay, you're spending this much because you can always use coupons for stuff like that too. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:08
Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:09
What if it was like, shopping? Like, okay, I'm going to put you in the mindset of Paige, like, maybe last year, like with the page that wants to improve her finances. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:21
Right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:21
Like, what would you. What would you think? Like, you would. What kind of conversation would you imagine would be the most helpful for you to distill down the shopping stuff? 
P
Paige P
34:32
I think it's more so like a two in one, because I would want the reflection and the information and also like the kind of conversation where it's like, do you really need this? Like, did you really need to buy that? 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:47
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
34:47
Or like something like that where it's like. Because I did notice, like where there was some reflection, where it's like basically like, oh, I think at the end it basically asked me about if I'm interested in me saying that. I'm kind of worried about it. And you remember what was happening. Like, I see like the reflection while also being informational with like the cost and how many times, which I like. And I think that with the shopping that I was doing, it probably would have been nice to have like that check in and be like, did you really need to go and spend X? Blah, blah. Or like, what was the purpose for it? Because half the time if you're going shopping, people aren't telling you and being like, asking why you're going. It's just, oh, you're going shopping. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:30
Okay. Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:32
Like your bank statement's not going to tell you that. 
P
Paige P
35:34
Exactly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:36
Yeah. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:41
Now going back to the feed itself. So X out of the chat, how would you feel at these reflection questions? Like, hey, did you use this? Let's say you bought something a week ago and then now let's say Sephora. I'm just going to use an example. Do you buy stuff at Sephora? Is that an okay example or. 
P
Paige P
35:59
Yes, that's fine. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:00
Okay. We went to Sephora last week. How, how, like, did you end up using this? 
P
Paige P
36:09
Right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:11
Would you like, prefer that to come up in conversation, like with the AI, or would you feel natural if that was also a card? Like, I mean, it's not what it says now, but like, imagine this was a card. 
P
Paige P
36:23
I would like that as a card because it's kind of like this one. Like, how are you feeling with it? Yeah, like, if it was like some like, X. I know on statements, like, it tells you like the store that you're at. So like, if it was something and it said so if I were to have gone to Abercrombie, like, it would be like, Abercrombie, X amount of dollars. If it was like, did you end up using this? Like, whatever you bought or like, was it worth it? Have you used it? Have you worn it? Like, I don't know. Yeah. Or especially like, even if it's seasonal too, in December or November, I think it would help resonate with people too. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:58
With. 
P
Paige P
36:59
If it's kind of. Was it a gift? 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:02
Yep. Which, like, you know, if you set aside money for it and it matters and it's okay. Versus like, I just bought this on a whim myself. 
P
Paige P
37:11
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:12
Gotcha. Actually, if you go back to the. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:16
Chat, I had another question on it before moving on. Just like, you can click on any of the tell me mores, what do you feel about. So right now our chat is just text. Right. Would it improve or not really improve the experience if it was a mix of text and like images or visuals or charts? 
P
Paige P
37:38
I feel like it depends. Like, for me, I don't mind that it's just text, but I do know some people are visual learners and listeners. So I think that just depends on the person. It wouldn't ruin the messaging or like the chat itself in any way. There were images as well, but as long as it's like text and image and not just like one or the other. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:00
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:01
So basically for yourself, you're like, hey, like, I don't mind the text, but like, if there were visuals to like reach people who like the visual part as well, like, it wouldn't take away from my experience. 
P
Paige P
38:13
Yeah. I mean, because in nursing, like they teach whenever you're giving like discharge information, like, you need to find out if people are visual learners or if they prefer written material. Because some people need to see it and some people need it written out. Some people need diagrams. So I think also like, that brain in me is like, saying, like, that wouldn't hurt anything as long as you just have both of them with it. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:37
No, that's really interesting you called it out from your experience because that is something we noticed as well. Like, there's people who are like very visual learners who are very allergic to what they call a wall of text. They're just like, I just stopped reading after like. And then like, some people, I would say, like my experience. Right. That visual learners are very allergic to walls of text and like visuals. People who are written people, like, like writing wouldn't vomit if they saw some visuals. As long as, like, it was still like well crafted content. 
P
Paige P
39:14
Yes, 100%. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:16
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:17
By the way, I think your app just like stopped presenting. 
P
Paige P
39:20
Yeah, I'm going back. I just realized that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:28
There we go. Yeah. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:32
Yeah, I guess Going back. You can go back to the feed. I kind of. I'm curious because, like, you, like, when did you actually. Did you go through the app, like, a bit before we chatted today? 
P
Paige P
39:43
I did, just because I wanted to see. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:46
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:46
Can you tell me, like, what your first experience was? Like, we can't perfectly replicate it, obviously, but I wanted to, like, at least get your recall, like, now that it's been a couple days, like, what you remember, like, what stood out to you. 
P
Paige P
40:00
So first I was absolutely terrified to look at it because I was like, I don't care. I don't want to know what I've spent. I've always been that way where I don't like to look at my bank account. I don't want to know what I spend because I know that I try to be good with my money. So, like, I'm like, it can't be that bad. So, like, I was scared to go on the app and have my bank account with it, but whenever I looked through it, I was like, okay, well, this makes sense. And I actually, like, understand where my money is going. And it's not as painful to look at a bank statement, like, as looking. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:32
At a bank statement. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:36
Got it. So you were worried initially, and then when you got into it, you felt like it was less terrifying. Could you actually maybe just like, reiterate again, like, what did you notice differently about using peak to look at these numbers versus, like, a bank statement? Because it's the same base information. 
P
Paige P
40:56
Actually, it is, but it's. There's information in somebody that will, like, not somebody, but, like, the chat will tell you basically what you could do and show you analysis instead of having to scroll through several deposits, several withdrawals, then have to compare month to month when you can just ask the chat and just say, hey, can we analyze and compare this amount? And also, I like the colors too. It's not just black and white on a page. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:27
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:28
So basically one of it is it's easier to, like, dig into the data than the banking app stuff. And then it's also like, I guess, friendlier colors. Your. 
P
Paige P
41:41
Your. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:41
The color scheme and everything, like, is. Is like something that you. 
P
Paige P
41:44
And, like, it's calming. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:47
Okay. 
P
Paige P
41:48
Because when you look at bank statements, it's just like you're. I don't know. For me, I get very nervous looking at. I don't like looking at it, which is awful. I know. But looking at this, at least there's, like, colors with it. And then plus it also has, like, the reminders with it which I never thought that I would have an app remind me to check my amount spending on a daily basis. Like, I have it set for, I think like 9pm every day. And I never thought that I would have something that would remind me to be able to check it. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:19
Got it. You. You like. So you like the reminders? 
P
Paige P
42:23
Because I might not go on it, but at least it reminds me that it's there and that like, if I am in a spot where I want to like, make sure of amounts or like, if I'm like, oh, have I done this? Or like however many times and I'm like, curious about it, I could just go on there whenever it reminds me if I forget about it for a second because I have a lot of apps on my phone and they are not in order like they usually do because I haven't had time to organize them. But getting that reminder in there, it's at least there. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:54
Got it, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:00
And then when it like broke down, like your, I guess, like money habits or patterns, did it feel to you, like, pretty accurate to like, what you perceived? 
P
Paige P
43:13
Yes, I would say so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:16
Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:18
Was there anything I surprised you? 
P
Paige P
43:21
Just how in depth it is. Like, I never expected an app to be like, in depth with the amounts and like actually having information with it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:31
Could you describe an instance of it? Like, the depth part? 
P
Paige P
43:35
I mean, with this part, Like, I don't even remember what the travel guard group incorporation is like. I could presume that it's like travel related, but just the fact that it says, like, you've been planning or just coverage active, it's taken care of and like, is it linked to a specific itinerary? Like, it's making me like, have to think and backtrack and be like, wait, okay, did I do Blah, blah. And also I think this is really helpful too, because half the time if you don't look at your bank account, which I really don't, if there was a spending or something, like, it will tell you on the app. So then you can automatically just see it and then have to go and cancel your card so that it's not hacked. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:16
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:17
So basically like the bank makes you feel like you don't want to look at the app, but you're also like, probably stuff is happening that I might not be aware of that's just there, like, taking my money. But this app, you like how in depth it is where it brings up something that like, you actually haven't thought of but compels you to be like, okay, Maybe I should look into. Am I paying for insurance that I'm not really using? 
P
Paige P
44:40
Exactly. I mean, last year, summer. Not this past summer, but like the summer last year, I didn't realize that I was, like, paying for a Just Ask.com subscription for the last year and a half. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:53
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
44:54
And I would have loved to have this app so that it would have told me because it was $25 a month coming out of my account and I had no idea. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:02
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:04
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:04
Your bank statement will be hard to parse, that kind of stuff just a little bit. Okay, well, awesome. Well, thank you so much. 
P
Paige P
45:13
On the. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:14
On walking through the app, the last part, I'm gonna have you actually stop presenting with your phone and actually pull up a link on your computer instead. So it's. It's. I just plop the URL into the. 
P
Paige P
45:33
Chat effects. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:37
And just a heads up. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:39
This prototype is very rough, but it's just a. It's a helpful way for us to understand. I mean, I won't over explain it, but it's. I'll explain at the end. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:53
Perfect. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:56
If you could present your screen as well, that'd be great. 
P
Paige P
45:59
I'm trying to find out what my password is for peak. I forget what I put it as. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:03
It's all good. 
P
Paige P
46:46
It's going to. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:04
Yeah. Okay, cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:09
So same thing. I might have you run through this twice, but depending on how much you're able to articulate the first time you go through it. But try your best to, like, voice out what's going through your head when you're working on this. 
P
Paige P
47:25
Okay. I mean, these ones are pretty straightforward because I know this one's for rent. This one, though, I would be kind of confused because that was for my car. So, like, I guess I would just put it with, like, my space because that's my vehicle. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:40
And then. 
P
Paige P
47:43
Error. Look good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:58
Oh, get in there. 
P
Paige P
48:06
The click. The mouse click is a little bit off, but it goes in after a minute. I wouldn't even know what to consider. This one. I think I went out one night and just wanted Taco Bell. So I would say convenience. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:34
Would you say that was more of a craving, though, or then I would. 
P
Paige P
48:37
Say, yes, definitely more of a craving. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:40
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
48:41
Because it's not like I can just go and. Right after a night out. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:49
Versus, I guess convenience would be like. More like I could have done this, but instead I ordered. 
P
Paige P
48:55
Yeah, exactly. I have no idea what this is. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:05
I guess, learning. 
P
Paige P
49:10
Oh, yeah. I think that was whenever I got my bartending license. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:13
That makes sense. 
P
Paige P
49:19
See, like this one like, it's not, like, my idea of, like, retail therapy. Like, I wouldn't consider that retail therapy because it's for gifts. So, like, I would put that as squad because it's four people. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:35
If you had an option for that to be gifts versus squad, would you take that option? 
P
Paige P
49:39
I would. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:40
Okay. 
P
Paige P
49:41
But, like, at the same time, though, I don't know. It's different now, though, just because of the fact that we're in December and things like, November time. But, like, if this was in June, July, I don't think I would use it because it's just like the season that we're in. The letters, are they just, like, basically saying, like, most importance? 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:20
Yes. 
P
Paige P
50:21
Okay. Hey, I'll take 59%. I am shocked, though, by the space one being in C category, because how expensive rent is. So, like, my question with this is, like, it's not. It's basically like whenever I said, like, my house because, like, rent was dragged to being, like, my house, like, my space. Like, yeah, it's not saying spend more, but, like, ways to, like, spend less surrounding the other aspects, which would make that the priority aspect. Or. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:53
Okay, yeah, I mean, I guess, like, the. What you would have interpreted as this prioritization should help me figure out where to cut back on. Not that because something is rated S tier, I should spend more money on it. 
P
Paige P
52:10
Okay, that makes sense. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:11
So that was a question for you. Actually, I think the recommendation said to spend more on it, but that's what. 
P
Paige P
52:17
I was kind of confused. I was like, wait, why would I want to spend more on it? Just because of the fact, like, I put the rent in the My home, but, like, there's nothing else to put me to, like, put rent in. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:27
Yeah, makes sense. 
P
Paige P
52:34
I like the urine tracker. The. Oh, before the month ends, I kind of like this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:58
Which part do you like? 
P
Paige P
53:00
It's just, like, cute. Like, it's like. Because it's like a pledge, basically, and then it signs your name on it, and basically it's just like, making you. Oh, my goodness. What is the word? Not motivated, not determined. There's a specific word where it's just like, I'm gonna do it no matter what. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:20
Like, commitment. 
P
Paige P
53:22
Yes. There's like, a different word that I'm thinking of too, because it's like, even if you don't want to, like, you just do it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:28
Okay. Actually, if you don't mind, in the remaining time, I actually wanted to have you go back to the URL. Like, just delete feed in the URL and just going to have you Walk through your thoughts again, because I know the first. So the first time some of it gets missed. I might actually ask some questions as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:57
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:03
Basically, like stepping through each question, asking what was. If this was helpful or not. How else should it have been asked? To learn more about you is the basic structure. 
P
Paige P
54:16
I like that, like, these are the three big ones. Because I always think rent is the. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:21
Most expensive one for me. 
P
Paige P
54:25
And for it to even pick out, like the hair salon too, because I don't typically. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:29
Get that done often. 
P
Paige P
54:30
So I didn't expect that to be like a big thing. I don't really think about travel much, so, like having the United Airlines flight on there because I don't really leave. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:45
Here that often, so not as helpful to have United. 
P
Paige P
54:49
Yeah. Because I really only travel if I'm going somewhere, like, to visit home. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:55
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
54:55
Or whatnot. I guess it's different if people travel frequently. But like, for me, the most I travel is going back home to New Jersey or coming back here. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:04
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
55:04
So for me, not really. I guess, like, I like seeing like, the grocery ones just because shoprite and Shift are always groceries that I get because it's free delivery and I don't have to stop studying for them. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:23
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:23
So for the shop. Right. And shipped stuff. Would it have been better for that to be grocery, like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:35
Yeah, okay. 
P
Paige P
55:38
Sorry. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:40
No, go on. 
P
Paige P
55:40
I was gonna say whenever I think of health, like, I think of like, the gym or if you're going to get a green juice or like something that's like medicine. Like, I don't think of the food store as related to health in a way, because, yes, it is. But at the same time, it's really not. Like, I just assume groceries. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:00
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:01
And do you mind going back to the first one again? 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:03
Yeah, of course. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:07
Like, did. Do you feel like sorting hair salon into looks good would be helpful or do you feel like that's kind of assumed or obvious? 
P
Paige P
56:21
I like the look good one just because I'm like, obviously you're getting your hair done. If you want to try and look better, like. Or, like, feel good, look good. Like, that's. But I do feel like that's just kind of obvious because it literally says hair nail. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:40
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:43
How would you, I guess, like, for. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:44
You. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:46
If you were to figure out, like, whether or not that was a necessary or, like, nice to have spend, would there have been another question that would have been better to ask? 
P
Paige P
56:56
I feel like if it's asking, like, if it was necessary, like, for. For me, I don't really Think about it. Because I haven't got my hair done in, like, six months. So, like, for me, like, that's just like, Yeah, I needed my hair done. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:09
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
57:09
But I guess there are some people that like, just get it done to get it styled and whatnot. So I think it would be different for others than it is for me. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:20
So in a way, like, if were able to check frequency and then determine, like, because someone who I guess goes maybe like every couple of weeks, like, you might be like, okay, maybe we should, like, dig into this more. But for you're like, I don't go often. So if I do go get it done, like, it's probably like I'm getting split ends. Like I'm trying to. 
P
Paige P
57:39
Exactly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:41
Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Yeah. We could move on. Yeah. 
P
Paige P
57:47
Do you have any questions on these ones? 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:50
Yeah, I think I got. Yeah. I mean, it sounds to me that, like, travel, like, this stuff is all sort of need to have stuff, so shop. 
P
Paige P
58:01
Right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:01
Ship. That's like groceries, like feeding yourself and then travels. Like, I had to visit family. 
P
Paige P
58:06
Yes. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:07
Got it. 
P
Paige P
58:11
These were not need to have. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:16
You don't think Crunch Fitness was neat to have? 
P
Paige P
58:19
I mean, I think, like, I guess if you're not conscientious of subscriptions and, like, memberships, like, for me, like, I know that I have this because I split the cost with my roommate because she sends me the 18 every month too, for, like, her half. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:37
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
58:38
So, like, for me, it's like, I don't really need to see it just because I'm aware. But at the same time, I could understand if, like, maybe I forgot about it. It would be like, oh, that's nice to know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:49
Yeah, got it. 
P
Paige P
58:52
And like, with the Target one, I also think that it doesn't really fit in much just because. Also, like, Target is like groceries for me because I have the target 365. So it's just like, I get the delivery from the groceries and they usually have discounts for me to use. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:11
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:14
How about doordash? I guess this was the. You said it was a craving. Yeah, for Taco Bell. Okay, so seems like these were like, kind off for you then, right? 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:25
Yes. Okay. 
P
Paige P
59:28
Well, I can understand that it could go under convenience, but, like, it's not as. Because, like, convenience can mean different things, I guess. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:38
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:39
Makes sense. Do you have an extra, like, three minutes to finish these, by the way? 
P
Paige P
59:43
Yeah, of course. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:44
Okay. Amazing. How about this stuff? 
P
Paige P
59:48
I mean, the corner bar and total line makes sense for squad, because Total line went to for friends giving corner bars are. We go every Monday and that's like our study in margarita Monday. So, like, those add up. And then the training also, like, that adds up with the learning just because it was for learning how to become a bartender. So, like, they all go together. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:00:12
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
01:00:13
And I feel like even like with total wine and more like the date night as well would make sense because, like, some people might be going to grab like a bottle of wine or like, if you're going to the corner bar because it's known as a restaurant, I guess. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:00:27
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:00:28
I guess for you in this case, right, like, would. Because I guess the point of the exercise is also to, like, minimize uncertainty around what certain things are for. Like, when it comes to, like, I guess for you, right, if it's total wine and corner bar, like, is it very likely is Squad like 80, or do you feel like actually it could be a number of different things? 
P
Paige P
01:00:51
For me, I would say, like, 80%, because half the time you're not really, like, I don't know for me, like, I wouldn't just go and get it unless, like, I'm doing something with, like, friends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:01:01
Yeah, got it. 
P
Paige P
01:01:03
Unless there was like, a way to do, like, in the other category, like, if there were to be like, four different things and there's like, other than at the end of it, like, if you had different categories and you could just have them take from the other and put it in the categories. I don't know. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:01:23
Yeah. I think here's a tick tock was gift. What's the red door salute? That was, I guess, drinks at the front. And so these are all besides, I guess, besides TikTok. These are all, like, drinks with friends, right? 
P
Paige P
01:01:39
Yeah. Las Palmas. Oh, that was a. We went to eat and then red door was out with friends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:01:47
Okay, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:01:49
And is that something that you would track? Like, you want to know your social spending? 
P
Paige P
01:01:54
I really would. Because sometimes. Well, sometimes when you go out, you don't realize how much you're spending when you're at a bar. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:02:00
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:02:01
Yeah, makes sense. 
P
Paige P
01:02:03
So. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:02:05
All good. All right, last question then on, like, you don't have to do this over again, but did you find this to be helpful? 
P
Paige P
01:02:18
I like it. I just think it would be nice if there was like, an eye or something like, with it to, like, the letter I to say, like, information of, like, what it's looking to be and, like, contain. So, like, whenever you're talking about work stuff, like, I don't know entirely, like, I technically could consider me getting the bartending training as like work stuff since I'm trying to do that for work. Or like health based, like if that's also containing different, like grocery stores or like retail therapy. Like what is retail therapy entailing? Is that just like overspending when you're like shopping retail or what? 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:02:57
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
01:02:58
And also the one thing that I did get confused with as I mentioned was the sabc. So like, maybe if there's like information like saying like, oh, this is what each tier is like pertaining to. Because usually I look at green. Like green is supposed to be like the priority one. And like, you know, like whenever it's like green means go. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:03:18
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:03:20
If you had to pick, let's say your categories. Right. Give me just five. That would be meaningful to you to sort. Like, what would those be? Like? It doesn't have to be the ones here. 
P
Paige P
01:03:30
Okay. Probably like health, groceries, social stuff, like anything socially related. I guess my space matters, but it really doesn't at the same time. Just because, like my dad helps with my rent, it just comes out of my account and then he venmos me back. So like, not really that one. Maybe learning. Because sometimes, like whenever I have to put stuff out for school, but not all the time. Does that happen and travel? Yep. I just feel like definitely groceries is the most important to me because I do spend most of my, like, I try to spend only most of my money on groceries. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:04:15
Do you feel like groceries is something you can save money on and you want to track it or you just want to like. I'm just wondering. 
P
Paige P
01:04:22
I would like to see how much I can spend because I feel like. No, there's always a way to lower cost. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:04:29
Yeah. 
P
Paige P
01:04:30
But it's like whenever I make my amount, especially like targets or like shipped or whatever, because I don't want to like take 20 minutes to drive there, 20 minutes to drive back. And when I. So like they have like the minimum of 35. So like maybe if there's a way to be like, okay, well, you spent this much. But like then I know at heart, like it only needs to be $35. So why am I spending this much? 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:04:51
Oh, so shift is when you, I guess buy groceries online, right? 
P
Paige P
01:04:55
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:04:55
And you do it for convenience? In a way. 
P
Paige P
01:04:57
In a way I do. Yeah. Just because of study. Like, it's like my way of saving more time so I could be studying more often. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:05:06
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:05:07
If you found that like you were spending two times more at shipped for the convenience, but you had an alternative to spend less and it took, like, an extra, like, I don't know, five, ten minutes to drive. Like, would that be meaningful to you? 
P
Paige P
01:05:20
Honestly? Yes. Because I'm more concerned. Like, if I did think that there was an active actual way for it to, like, save money without it being, like, 20 minutes out, 20 minutes back, I would do it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:05:31
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:05:32
Okay. 
P
Paige P
01:05:32
But, like, if it's only, like, $2, like, I'm not really. I'll eat the $2. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:05:38
Yeah, Got it. 
P
Paige P
01:05:44
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:05:45
Well, thank you so much, Paige. This is really helpful. We will settle everything comp wise on the platform, and if we have more questions, we'll reach out. But thank you so much for your time. 
P
Paige P
01:05:57
No, of course. I hope this I had enough information to help you all with the research. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:06:02
Yeah, this was super helpful. 
P
Paige P
01:06:04
I'm glad. Thank you so much. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:06:06
Thank you. All right, take care. 
P
Paige P
01:06:08
Bye. Bye
