S
Sherry Jiang
00:00
Like half the time in like California. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
00:02
Oh, okay. That's nice. 
T
Taniya Richardson
00:04
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:05
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:07
Awesome. Well, let's just get started. I can maybe introduce myself and explain a little bit more about what we'll be doing today. So I'm Sherry. I'm doing research for peak. We're getting an understanding of how people are navigating this different decisions around money, especially post graduation. So this conversation will in for the first part be focused on really just getting to know you a little bit more. And then the second part, we'll be showing you some very basic test apps that we've built just to get your feedback. And everything is meant to be just like however you feel and be as honest as possible. You will not hurt my feelings. Don't worry about that. And just like, yeah, like articulate like what's on your mind as if there's like a microphone to your head. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
00:59
Yeah, that sounds great. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:03
Awesome. Well, I'll just get started with the first part. Just tell me more about yourself. You already told me where you live. Washington, D.C. but maybe like what you're currently doing when you graduated, all of that stuff. 
T
Taniya Richardson
01:17
Yeah, okay. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
01:18
Yeah. So like I said, I'm currently in D.C. i just graduated college in May and I was a nursing major. I'm now a registered nurse. So it's so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:29
Thank you. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
01:30
So, so important for me to be like financially stable. So I'm really just trying my best to like get my foot into it and learn about like stocks and high yield savings and all these different things that I need to do. So I was really interested in PEAK because of that. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:44
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:46
And what made you decide to become a registered nurse? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
01:49
Yeah, so like when I was younger, my grandma, she was like sick a lot and so I would kind of see like all the healthc, her field workers, the doctors and nurses take care of her. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:59
And I was like, I want to. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
01:59
Do something like that. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:01
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:02
Yeah, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:03
That's, that's awesome. And you mentioned that you are like figuring out all this stuff now that you know you're. You had a adult kind of lifestyle. What has been challenging? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
02:18
Yes, I guess what's been the most challenging is trying to like save as much as I can because now I have like real bills, like I have rent to pay and all this stuff and like debt that I'm trying to pay off. So it's just like learning how to like allocate everything and also like set up like 401ks and like Ross. It's like, I feel like it's so much So I just wanted someone to kind of help me and like, walk me through everything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:43
Yeah. So how did you decide on, like, how much? Maybe we'll tackle the budgeting one. But, like, how much? How much is a good amount to save? Like, did you sit down with somebody to figure it out? Did you pull up a spreadsheet? Like, how did you walk through that? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
03:02
Yes, honestly, I just, I mean, I made my own spreadsheet, but I kind of got a lot of my information from tick tock. I know it's like not a good thing, but everyone kind of said you should say like 30 of like your income and stuff. So that's what I've been doing. 
T
Taniya Richardson
03:16
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:16
Okay, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:19
And what have been easier parts to find savings in you think? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
03:27
The easiest parts? I don't know. I guess it's just like creating like goals for like what I'm saving for. But like, now that I know, like, okay, like I want to buy a. 
T
Taniya Richardson
03:38
New brand new car. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
03:40
So I've been able to kind of like, really prioritize saving and like, putting that aside so I don't touch it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:47
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:50
Anything that you felt like you had to change in terms of your habits when you started being more mindful of like saving 30%? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
03:57
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:58
Oh my gosh. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
03:59
Once I started doing that, I always saw how much money I had in my savings and I was like, really trying to just pull from it and like spend it like regular money. And I was like, oh my gosh, I need to stop doing that because I feel like it's a really bad habit. 
T
Taniya Richardson
04:10
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:11
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:13
So basically, like in the past, like, you were like just spending what you have versus right now. You're like, okay, I have this goal I want to hit. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
04:23
Yeah, basically. 
T
Taniya Richardson
04:25
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:27
Got it, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:28
And if you were to look at, I guess maybe like the last two weeks of spending, what do you feel like were some things that you spent money on that you felt like was worth it? You felt good about it? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
04:42
I feel like was worth it. Probably. I pay rent, so that was like my first. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:48
Yeah. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
04:49
So I think I felt really good about that. I think. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:52
Yeah, yeah. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
04:53
And I paid off a little bit of my student loans, which I think was good. So it was worth that for sure. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:01
What about something that you felt like wasn't worth it? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
05:04
Yes. I like DoorDash and like UberEats a lot. I feel like I could literally just make food at home instead of paying for that. So that was bad. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:15
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:16
And what made it, like, not Worth it for you, if you were to think about it. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
05:20
Like, I just think it's not worth it because, like, I spend money on, like, the delivery and, like, the tip, and then it's literally gone within, like, 10 minutes of me eating it, which is. I just feel like it was pointless to spend all that money on it, so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:33
Yeah. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:35
What? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
05:35
Got. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:35
What made you, I guess, get into the habit of, like, ordering, like, food delivery versus, like, making it at home? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
05:42
Well, like, because I was in college for the past four years, and all. 
T
Taniya Richardson
05:45
We did is order food to the. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
05:47
Dorms because we didn't have a car and, like, no transportation, like, everything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:50
Yeah. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
05:51
Far away from campus. So I feel like I'm still, like, in that, like, mindset. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:56
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:58
So I guess if you were to kind of see, like, okay, this is how much I'm spending on delivery, this is how much it would cost just to make it at home. It would make you want to potentially put in more effort and just make. 
T
Taniya Richardson
06:09
Exactly. Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:11
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:12
What about other things that, like, let's. Let's maybe look at. I don't know. Do you do much shopping, like, online or in store? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
06:22
Yeah, a little bit. I do online shopping. Yeah. 
T
Taniya Richardson
06:24
Okay. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
06:25
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:27
Tell me more about, like, maybe the last thing that of note that you bought online. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
06:35
Yeah, the last thing I bought online was, like, from Shein. I think I spent, like, $150 on that. I got, like, some more clothes, which I probably didn't need, but, you know. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:49
Got. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:50
Did you buy it during, like, holiday season or. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
06:52
Yeah, it was Christmas, so it was a big. So some of them were like, yeah. 
T
Taniya Richardson
06:58
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:58
Did you buy it for yourself, or was it, like, a gift for other people or. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
07:02
Yeah, I bought some stuff for myself, and then I got gifts for other people, too. 
T
Taniya Richardson
07:06
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:07
So a mix of both. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:08
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:10
And when you said it was a big deal, you mean, like, the. The actual site had, like, a big sale or deal going on, which is. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
07:16
Yeah, like a big sale. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:18
Okay. Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:21
And I guess if you were to, like, think about. So you spent $150, like, what amount of the spending do you feel like was worth it that you're, like, wearing it or you actually. You like it or you give it. Gave it to somebody, you were like, okay, like, that's worth my money. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
07:39
Yeah, I think. Well, I spent, like, a hundred of that on, like, gifts, and I felt like that was worth it because, like, I kind of got to, like, give that back. And they were so happy, and they really needed It. Well, they didn't need it, but I think it was just nice to give that to them as a gift, so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:55
Yeah, yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:57
And then the other 50 was like, for yourself then, right? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
08:00
For me, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:02
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:03
Have you used the things you bought since you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:07
Not yet. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
08:08
No. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:09
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:11
So basically it was a bit of like, hey, I want to buy stuff for people. There's a deal going on. Oh, these also look kind of cool. I'm gonna get that. 
T
Taniya Richardson
08:19
Yeah, exactly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:20
Just haven't found a, I guess, occasion to. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
08:23
An occasion yet. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:24
Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:26
What did you get? Out of curiosity? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
08:29
I got this really cute, like, winter coat. You know, those coats that kind of look like, dresses? I've been really mine for a long time, so I just got that because. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:37
Yeah, okay. Gotcha, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:40
So you were like, oh, I. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:41
This is cute. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
08:42
Like, I kind of want one. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:44
Okay, got it. So it's, like, cute. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:49
You feel like it's a bit of a. Nice to have for yourself? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
08:52
Yeah, I think so. I think it's nice to try to, like, spoil. Spoil yourself. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:57
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:59
Makes sense. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:02
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:03
What about, like, I guess, you know, Washington, D.C. is a city. Do you go out to, like, eat with friends and stuff? And how do you, I guess, like, what's that, like, social budget or, like, social spending look like for you? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
09:17
Yes. So that is something we really try to budget a lot because a lot of my friends either just graduated or they're still in school. So, like, we always try to find, like, free or, like, affordable things to do in D.C. because, like, they have a lot of, like, free events and, like, clubs are normally free. So, like, everything is pretty. Like, I budget that well. I feel like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:38
Yeah, okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:40
Because there's just so many options. That. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
09:42
There's so many options. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:43
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:45
So if you had to. Okay, if you had to say, let's say two things you think you budget well, what would those be? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
09:52
Two things I think I budget well, definitely, like, my bills. Like, I feel like I make sure to, like, save and, like, budget enough for that, like, paying rent and stuff like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:03
Yeah. So necessities. You're like, I always covered, so. 
T
Taniya Richardson
10:08
Exactly. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
10:09
Necessities. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:10
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:14
Anything else that, like, comes to mind? You're like, you know, I think I'm pretty in control. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:18
I like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:19
I got the sunblock for the budget. 
T
Tonyia Richardson
10:21
See, let's see. 
T
Taniya Richardson
10:23
I don't know. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
10:24
Maybe I'm like, what else does that. Us, like, in control? I would Say, like, forms of transportation. Because, like, I have a boyfriend, we're long distance right now, so we're like always like, transporting to see each other at least once a month. So I always make sure I like, save as much money as I can for that or like, budget that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:47
Yeah. So you said that you like, is he like in a nearby city where you. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
10:54
It's like three to four hour drive away, so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:58
Okay, yeah, gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:00
That's still long distance, but yeah, I guess, like, better than like a flight, because that could. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
11:05
Exactly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:06
Yeah, yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:09
Now, what are two things that you think you could do a better job of budgeting? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
11:14
Yeah, definitely. Like, of course, like the doordash, like, spending money on like, fast food, I guess, stuff like that. And probably just like shopping for like, clothes and like, makeup and stuff. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:28
Yeah, yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:32
Thanks for sharing that. My next question is, you mentioned like, some things around goals, which is interesting. How do you, like, how do you think about like, what you're doing this for? Right. There's like, you mentioned the 30%. You mentioned, like, maybe I want to get a car. Like, what motivates you? Like, what goal are you, like, working towards? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
11:55
Yes, Honestly, I really just want, like, financial stability. Like, I. And I hate to say this, but I think I really want to be like the richest person in my family. So like, that's. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:06
That's a great goal. Yeah. 
T
Taniya Richardson
12:07
Yeah. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
12:09
Because like, I. I was never really born into like, big wealth or anything like that. So like, what motivates me is just like actually setting goals and making sure I like, save enough to like, hit them and prioritize for that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:21
Yeah. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
12:22
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:23
Okay, gotcha. So it's. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:25
It's more of like a general feeling of like, hey, I'm accomplishing something. I'm disciplined and like, yay. Like, building this over time versus, like, oh, it's specifically just for like a car. Specifically. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
12:37
Yeah, it's like building over time. Yeah, definitely. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:40
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:41
And what's. What would you say is the biggest gap that's keeping you from feeling 100% satisfied in that one area? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
12:49
Yeah, I feel like the biggest gap that's keeping me 100% satisfied is like, I don't know, like, I feel like I really want to, like, work towards, like, saving and all that stuff. But then I feel like with like, the bills that I have to pay and the other stuff, it's kind of hard to like, manage between those because I feel like the bills are taking away from as much as I would like to save and stuff. 
T
Taniya Richardson
13:13
You know, so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:15
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:16
So is it also, like, the feeling of, like, being on top of everything? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
13:20
Yeah, yeah, it's that feeling. It's a lot. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:24
Okay. Yeah, for sure. Awesome. Well, that's it in terms of the questions at the start. Now I'm going to just transition to having you play around with a few different apps. I'm going to send you some links that you can open up in the chat, in this. Are you on your phone right now? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
13:47
Yes, I'm waiting for my computer to, like, turn on. It's been dead for the long. So it's turning on now if you want me to do it on there. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:55
Yeah, it might be. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:56
It might better because I'm not sure these work on the phone, so. Yeah, see if your computer boots up. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
14:06
Okay. Yeah, it's in the process. Are these, like, apps that I would have to download on it or. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:11
No, website links. And all of the data is fake data, so they're not your transactions. 
T
Taniya Richardson
14:18
Okay, cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:20
We're just, like, getting your feedback on how the interaction feels like. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
14:24
Okay, cool. Also, I'm curious, like, what made you start, like, apps like this and be. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:30
A part of it? 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:32
Yeah, well, I find that most. I never really liked the money apps that were out there because they focus a bit too much on, like, the numbers. And it felt. Didn't feel. It's like, it's called personal finance. But I'm like, there's nothing personal about just seeing, like, a bank statement. And I. I find that so much of the way I view my money might be different from somebody else. Right. Like, maybe I like going to Starbuck every single day because that's where I study or that's where I, like, get work done. But for somebody else, that might be like, oh, I just drive by on my way to work and I don't really care for it too much. But now that I see the number, maybe I'd rather just make it at home. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:16
But that could be the same number for the two of us, but it means something completely different. So anyways, that's the motivation is I find that the emotional intelligence of a lot of apps really lack for money, and that's actually what I think is the most important. So that's my motivation. 
T
Taniya Richardson
15:34
Oh, that's so cool. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:36
Yeah, I love that. 
T
Taniya Richardson
15:40
So nice. Okay, so let me see. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
15:43
It's like halfway there. 
T
Taniya Richardson
15:45
It's just updating. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:48
No, it's all good. I. I mean, I'll try to see if this works on the phone. I can try my phone right now, but otherwise, I think easier. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
16:19
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:19
You have to use it on your computer. It looks pretty janky on the phone. 
T
Taniya Richardson
16:23
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:24
Then build it to work on the mobile web so it looks a bit funky. 
T
Taniya Richardson
16:31
It is completely understandable. My computer, like, it's coming, so. All good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:39
Are you from the D.C. area originally or did you move there or. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
16:43
No, I just moved here for school. I'm from Kentucky though. 
T
Taniya Richardson
16:50
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:51
Gotcha. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:51
That's too far away, I guess. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
16:54
Yeah, it's like a nine hour drive, so it's not too bad. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:59
Okay. 
T
Taniya Richardson
17:00
Yeah. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
17:01
So you like California? 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:03
Yeah, I mean, I've. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:04
I've been there since high school. It's. It's got like a little bit of everything. Got nature. You have like, you know, I'm. I'm from like San Francisco Bay area. So you've got like, good, like bars, restaurants, music. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
17:22
Only thing is the. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:24
I would say, like, safety in San Francisco is not the best. It's gotten better. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:28
But not. Yeah, it's that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:31
That's always a bit of a. Yeah. Bit of a challenge. 
T
Taniya Richardson
17:35
Yes. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
17:36
I've literally always wanted to live in California, so that's. 
T
Taniya Richardson
17:40
That's cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:41
Yeah, I like Cal. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:42
Oh, the other thing is this tax, the income taxes. Saving from taxes is a lot. 
T
Taniya Richardson
17:47
It's a lot. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
17:48
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:48
It's like another like 9%. 
T
Taniya Richardson
17:51
Oh, no. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:53
I don't know what it's like in D.C. but. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
17:55
Yeah, D.C. has like a big. 
T
Taniya Richardson
17:57
A big thing too. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
17:59
Oh, my gosh. 
T
Taniya Richardson
18:00
Yay. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
18:00
Okay, finally turned on. 
T
Taniya Richardson
18:01
So let me join from. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:03
Yeah, that'll be great. So I'll have you present from there as well. So take your time. I'll see you and when you join. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
18:10
Okay, perfect. 
T
Taniya Richardson
18:11
All right. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
25:08
Hello. 
T
Taniya Richardson
25:10
Hi, I'm back. Sorry it took so long. Oh, yeah, all good. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
25:18
All right, no problem. 
T
Taniya Richardson
25:20
Let me share with you the first one. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:27
Okay. 
T
Taniya Richardson
25:29
Concept. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:31

And then I'll add the others as well, which you can open up when we get there. 
T
Taniya Richardson
25:39
Okay. Oh, this is cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:05
Yeah. By the way, do you mind presenting your screen so I can follow along? Yeah. 
T
Taniya Richardson
26:18
All right. Sharing. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:28
So, yeah, feel free to just click around. I'm gonna just try to stay generally silent. I'll jump in with some questions here and there, but just use it as naturally as possible. Like you don't have to worry about what you think I should have you do. Just like do whatever you. You feel like and then articulate your thoughts. 
T
Taniya Richardson
26:47
Thoughts out loud and. Yeah. Okay. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
26:49
So this is just like me like having like a fake account, I guess. 
T
Taniya Richardson
26:53
And like these are. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:54
Yeah. Like fake transactions. 
T
Taniya Richardson
26:57
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:57
But you can maybe relate to, like, things that you've actually bought. Like if. If it's like Urban Outfitters, right. Like, you probably have a sense of what you could have bought at a similar place you went shopping. 
T
Taniya Richardson
27:10
Okay, true. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:13
98. 
T
Taniya Richardson
27:15
That was impulse for sure. It. Any tips? Oh, no. What happened? Okay, It. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:16
Yeah, it clicked out. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:18
I think it said something like, stress spending sometimes is okay. Maybe you want to consider, like, other things that you like to do to relieve stress in the future. Something like that. 
T
Taniya Richardson
28:30
Okay. Urban Outfitters, I would say. Yeah, it was only like $40. Okay. All right. This one's higher than your usual. That's cool. This is cute. All right, next is Postmates late night delivery rep day. Oh, okay. You want me to go to the next one? 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:39
Yeah, I think that's actually most of the. This one I can explain, like, what it's supposed to do because this one we didn't build it out for this particular one we're testing. But basically what it's doing is trying to learn a bit more about you with, like, recent transactions. Obviously here they are fake with the intention that they can, like, help you build a better understanding of, like, your own spending patterns and then use that to, like, figure out where to save more. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
32:14
Yeah, I like it. 
T
Taniya Richardson
32:15
It was cute. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
32:16
It's a great idea. 
T
Taniya Richardson
32:17
I like it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:20
Were there. Yeah. Like, how did you feel about the chat? 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:24
Like, what did. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:24
What were some things you liked or disliked? When you're going through. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
32:28
I like the chat. I think it's a good way to really, like, talk it out and, like, put into words what you're spending. But I think the thing. 
T
Taniya Richardson
32:37
I. I don't know if. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
32:38
I don't know if I don't like it. But also I think it can be a little, like, tedious. 
T
Taniya Richardson
32:42
Like the questions. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
32:43
Like, I feel like I would want to answer all those questions, so I don't know. But it was. It was nice, though. And it seemed like it's like a real person. Like, it doesn't sound like a normal AI answer, which is good. 
T
Taniya Richardson
32:56
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:57
Yeah. Which. Which questions were did you find a. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
33:03
Little bit more tedious? Just the ones like, oh, like, what are your other routines that you're doing? Like, I don't know. Like, I feel like that. Like, I don't know. I just. At the time, I wouldn't feel like answering it. 
T
Taniya Richardson
33:14
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:15
Okay, so you felt like it was a little off topic? 
T
Taniya Richardson
33:18
Yeah. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:19
Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:23
And how did you feel like. 
T
Taniya Richardson
33:27
About. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:28
The part at the end that gave. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:31
You options around how to continue? Like the dig deeper, summarize and then the tip. 
T
Taniya Richardson
33:37
I love that. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
33:38
I really do. It gives you the option to really, like, get advice or, like, just wrap up the conversation or dig deeper. I really think that's super cool. 
T
Taniya Richardson
33:47
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:48
Okay, like, yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:52
And what. What do you like about having the option of what to do with the chat? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
33:59
I think I like that I can kind of just like. Like have control of it, which is really nice. And I also like the fact that I don't have to like, go out of my way to type of questions. Like, I like that it's already there, so I can just, like, pick which one I would rather it do than me having to, like, type and all that. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:15
Okay. 
T
Taniya Richardson
34:16
Super efficient. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:18
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:19
So part of the tediousness from the other parts of the chat were just like, the fact that you had to type versus. 
T
Taniya Richardson
34:26
Yeah, I like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:27
Yeah, got it. And what. 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:38
Did you. I guess if you were to think about, like, your own spending, because this is not your spending, were there areas in your own life where you think the spending can be ambiguous? Where, like, questions like these are helpful to understand, like, why you bought something, what you bought something for. 
T
Taniya Richardson
34:56
Yeah, definitely. Like, as I was doing this one and seeing, like, the postmates and, like. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
35:02
Doing that, I think that is really, like, valuable to my life because I was like, okay, like, maybe will help me feel realize why I'm, like, spending so much and, like, doing all that stuff. 
T
Taniya Richardson
35:13
Yeah, for sure. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:16
Got it, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:18
Okay, I'm gonna now send you a second one to play around with. Oh, yeah, it's already in the chat. So if you can pull up that link and then present it and go through it. 
T
Taniya Richardson
35:31
Okay. 
T
Tonyia Richardson
35:34
Let me go back. 
T
Taniya Richardson
35:44
Concept number two. Okay. Okay, perfect. When you bought these items from Macy's, where you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:02
Oh, Tanya, I don't see your screen. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
36:05
Oh, sorry. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:07
It's okay. 
T
Taniya Richardson
36:08
Can you see it now? 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:12
I can't see it. 
T
Taniya Richardson
36:16
I feel like I'm still sharing. Let me try to share again. Entire screen. Okay. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
36:29
I don't know if it, like unchair. 
T
Taniya Richardson
36:31
When I went to it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:33
Okay, I can see it pop up now. Okay, perfect. And also, don't mind the formatting. I know it's a bit long, but just. 
T
Taniya Richardson
36:43
Yeah, yeah. Okay. When you bought items at Macy's. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:53
Were you. 
T
Taniya Richardson
36:58
98 looking through. Oh, okay. I'll say it was a sale, Limited edition, special release. Oh, it won't let me. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:33
Oh, click on hide. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:35
Oh, yeah, there. Yeah, you can try again. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:40
Yeah. 
T
Taniya Richardson
37:41
Oh, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:13
Just type. Type the same thing again. Sorry. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:15
Just a Probably a little bug. 
T
Taniya Richardson
38:17
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:18
Sorry about it. 
T
Taniya Richardson
38:19
No, you're fine. You're already looking for this with a deal catch your eye. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:33
It. So this, at this point, it actually is supposed to wrap up the chat. I'm gonna have you try a second one because it's. It kind of works, but there's something that wasn't working. I'm gonna just. You can finish chat. It's okay. Try. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:46
Do you buy coffee much? 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:47
Is the second one related to you or. Not really. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
39:51
Not really, but I can do it. 
T
Taniya Richardson
39:52
I mean, I don't mind. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
39:54
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
39:57
Or you can try maybe just browsing and it found me option. Let me see if that. 
T
Taniya Richardson
40:08
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:08
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna. 
T
Taniya Richardson
40:12
I love when that happens. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
40:17
Browsing. Yeah, It's working now. Yeah. 
T
Taniya Richardson
40:42
Yeah. I don't know what I'm supposed to say. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:14
Yeah, it's done. Yeah. It's summarized. Yeah. 
T
Taniya Richardson
41:17
Okay. Perfect. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:18
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:19
Okay. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
41:24
So I know the first one was a little buggy. Yeah. So the difference between this one and then the last one was just the. It's actually the same, but the kind of the way we asked the questions was different. Wanted to get your thoughts as you were going through the questions as well. 
T
Taniya Richardson
41:41
Okay. Okay. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
41:43
Yeah, I liked it. I do, I think kind of the same as, like, going after last time, though, like, the typing it out and all that. And I know you said, like, the first one was a bug, but, like, I feel like if that was to, like, happen consistently, and I'm like, keep talking. I'm like, oh, my gosh, and we'll just end. But I really like it. Like, I like these different options. Like, they're just browsing or like, I've been eyeing for a while. I think that's super cute and it really helps, like, put everything into perspective. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:11
So I think that part is helpful. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:13
I like that. 
T
Taniya Richardson
42:14
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:16
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:18
Did you. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:21
Was there any, I guess, noticeable difference for you around, like, what you got from the questions that were being asked? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
42:32
I think the noticeable differences, like, the first one, I feel like they were really more like. I don't know, I feel like they kind of really geared to your emotions. They're like, okay, like, I hear you. Like, I'm sorry that happened to you. Like, when I kind of, like, told them, like, I was stressed out. Like, I feel like the first one, it kind of really goes more into, like, you can. I guess you can, like, just talk more about, like, your emotions and what led you to, like, spin. I feel like with this one, it's more just based on, like, structure and like, by the book of, like, different. 
T
Taniya Richardson
43:01
You know, different things like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:03
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:07
And is there one that you prefer or you think a mix of both, depending on the circumstance? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
43:12
Yeah, I think a mix of both. 
T
Taniya Richardson
43:14
Depending on the circumstance. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:17
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:18
So is it accurate to say that sometimes you want it to just listen, reflect, help you understand your emotions, and other times you're like, I want to get to the point and just learn something? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
43:29
Exactly. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:32
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:32
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:32
Got it. Cool. We can go to the next one. 
T
Taniya Richardson
43:37
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
43:40
So just under constant three. 
T
Taniya Richardson
43:46
Oh, okay. Let me go. I hope I don't have to, like, I probably have to. Oh, no, it's there. Okay. Concept three. Oh, do I have to sign in? 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:03
I think you could just add any email to this. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:08
But we're not really, like, we're not. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:10
Doing anything with your information because it's fake data. 
T
Taniya Richardson
44:14
Yeah. What? 
T
Tonyia Richardson
44:30
Oh, no. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:38
Okay. 
T
Taniya Richardson
44:38
I don't know. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
44:39
Like, all these passwords are breaches. 
T
Taniya Richardson
44:42
I don't know what to do with that. What? 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:49
Oh, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:50
If this is causing a problem. 
T
Taniya Richardson
44:56
Let me see. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
44:59
Let me try to just use, like, a different one. 
T
Taniya Richardson
45:05
I think I've used this app before. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:07
I don't know why. 
T
Taniya Richardson
45:08
With they. I'm not allowed to. It's pretty weird. 
T
Tonyia Richardson
45:12
Oh, God. 
T
Taniya Richardson
45:13
Okay, let's go to my email. Okay. Okay, perfect. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:34
Okay, cool. 
T
Taniya Richardson
45:40
Oh, cute. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:41
Okay, so, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:44
To start playing around on this particular screen. 
T
Taniya Richardson
45:49
Okay, let me know what you picked this time. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:42
So the part that I wanted you to pay attention to is, I guess the part that's different, which is the thing at the top. You have the little, like, three questions and then the tracker. Do you feel like this added anything? Kind of nice to have. Didn't really do much. Like, what's the. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
47:01
Yeah, I think it's really nice to. 
T
Taniya Richardson
47:03
Have because I like that you can. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
47:05
Like, see and, like, cross off, like, the things that it asked you and, like, it puts it in perspective for me. Like, okay, like, this is why I did this purchase. 
T
Taniya Richardson
47:14
So it's nice. I like it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:18
So you liked it because it. Did it help you figure out, like, why these questions are being asked? 
T
Taniya Richardson
47:26
Yeah, definitely. Let's see some tips. Okay. This is nice. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
48:02
I think the only feedback I have for this is, like, I would want more, like, financial tips, I guess, to, like, show actually tell me, like, how I can do more, like, with budgeting or be, like, have better habits when it comes to spending. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:16
Yeah. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
48:16
Because this is, like, kind of like keeping me, like, makes me want to spend more. It's like, oh, keep an eye on the release. Calendar and, like, think about each, like, I don't know, like, I feel like this is like, encouraging me to spend more money. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:29
Yeah, yeah, got it. That makes sense. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:33
It's really nice though. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
48:34
I like it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:37
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:38
Do you like the fact that, like, you started out just like, sharing more about the purchase and then getting into advice? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
48:48
Yeah, I do. Because I feel like it feels more like, you know, like it's getting to know me a little bit and more like a person and not just like. 
T
Taniya Richardson
48:56
A robot, I guess. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:04
Got it. All right, I will have you now in the interest of time, look at the last one. 
T
Taniya Richardson
49:12
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:13
And then we'll do like a wrap up. 
T
Taniya Richardson
49:15
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:16
You're doing great. Thank you so much. 
T
Taniya Richardson
49:18
Thank you. This is really fun. This is cool. Oh, gosh. And. It. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:09
Oh, you're on mute, by the way. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:11
I haven't. 
T
Taniya Richardson
51:15
Been able to hear you. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
51:20
Oh, sorry. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:21
It's okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:23
I was like. Okay, you're taking some time to click through that. I realize you're on mute. Wait, did I send you the right one? Oh, I think I need to send you a different one. Sorry. Let me. Is this journal? Oh, it should be correct. Okay, click. Click something. Click. How do you feel about it? 
T
Taniya Richardson
52:01
See what comes up. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:03
Okay. Yeah, it is correct. Sorry, just so that pops up. Yeah. 
T
Taniya Richardson
52:09
You said $98 and only three times. Which suggest recurring shop and habit. How do I submit it? 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:43
Press enter. 
T
Taniya Richardson
52:45
Yeah, I'm pressing it. It's not gonna. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:54
Oh, thinking. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
52:55
Oh, on its own. 
T
Taniya Richardson
52:57
Okay, that's cool. That happens. That's great. Ready to break the habit? Yeah. Oh, there it is. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:40
Actually, if you just stop. I think it just. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
53:43
Yeah, okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:45
It's okay. I can stop you here. It's fine. 
T
Taniya Richardson
53:47
We'll just. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:47
It will just keep going with the questions. I'll be maybe more pointed with the question, but how do you feel about this kind of interaction versus, like a chat? 
T
Taniya Richardson
54:03
I don't know. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
54:04
For me personally, I like the chat, I think. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:07
Okay. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
54:08
Yeah, it was very quick and like. 
T
Taniya Richardson
54:11
You can, like, you can press options. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
54:14
Different options, and you can choose, like, how you want it to respond, like dig deeper or all that stuff. 
T
Taniya Richardson
54:54
Hello? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
55:29
Sorry, I'm just gonna finish it on my phone. 
T
Tonyia Richardson
55:34
Oh, my God. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:36
No, it's okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:36
I just. I just removed it. I think there's some. 
T
Taniya Richardson
55:39
It's so good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:41
Yeah, I think we. 
S
Sherry Jiang
55:42
We can do it this way for the rest of it. No worries. What were you in the middle of saying? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
55:48
Yeah, I said I kind of like the chat version better. 
T
Taniya Richardson
55:52
I do. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
55:53
I like having the option. You know, how I say like dig deeper or give tips or what more do you like? Because I feel like you control over like how the AI thing responds to you versus with this. It's like it may be like, I don't know, like giving too much or just like some like, I don't know. I feel like I would rather have an option of what I can choose for it to like respond with. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:19
Got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:20
Makes sense. 
T
Taniya Richardson
56:21
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
56:22
In the remaining time, you know, now that you've looked across everything. Right. Can you recall one particular thing that you felt like was really cool and delightful? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
56:34
Yeah, one thing I found was really cool and delightful is like how it actually could like understand like what I was saying and then come up with follow ups. Like I remember this one time I was like, oh yeah, I'm really stressed with work. That's why I got the purchase. It was like, oh my gosh, work can be so stressful. I'm sorry you're going through that. I just really like that aspect that it kind of really geared to like an emotional thing as well. And then after it started to give like advice on like things to do, which I think is really good for your mental health. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:03
And I feel like a lot of. 
T

Apps don't do that. So that was pretty cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:06
Gotcha. Do you feel like a lot of. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:08
Apps just go into like advice and telling you what to do without trying to get to know you better? 
T
To’nyia Richardson
57:15
Yeah, definitely. I think so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:18
Got it. And then tell me something that you didn't like that much. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
57:24
What I didn't like. Like you said, when I'm on like an app or a website, I don't like to type too much. So I think I didn't like the last one, the free form journaling. And like, I feel like it was asking a lot of questions and I felt like I had to like type a lot and like really think about it. So that was the only thing I didn't like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:43
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
57:45
If you had more like, you know how some of the chats had the pill options that you can select, would you prefer like the chat to have more of these kind of things that give you options to tap? If you wanted to write free form, you could still do it, but you at least start with options. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
58:02
Yes, I like that. Having the options would be good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:05
Yeah, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:07
And then what did you find? Hard to understand. 
T
Taniya Richardson
58:13
Hard to understand. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:15
I don't know. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
58:16
I feel like it was pretty easy to understand. 
T
Taniya Richardson
58:19
Let me think. What was the hardest part? I don't know. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
58:24
I guess the hardest part. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:28
Would probably. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
58:28
Just be, like, me having to think about it and, like, what I use these purchases for and, like, what was, like, the actual reason? Because sometimes, you know, you just, like, impulsively buy things and you don't even really think about. About, like, why or, like, what made you do it. So I guess the hardest part for me was more of, like, an internal thing, trying to figure out, like, the actual reasons why I bought something in the first place. 
T
Taniya Richardson
58:49
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:49
Got it. Did you find. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:51
Did you find that to be a. 
S
Sherry Jiang
58:53
Helpful exercise or sometimes you're like, hey, it's. It's not that deep. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
58:57
I think it was helpful for sure. 
T
Taniya Richardson
59:00
Yeah, I think it was helpful. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:02
Gotcha. 
T
Taniya Richardson
59:03
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:04
Well, that's actually it in terms of my question. Questions. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:08
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:09
I appreciate your time, Tanya. This was very helpful. 
T
Taniya Richardson
59:13
Thank you so much. This is really great. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
59:15
I loved it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:17
I'm glad. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
59:17
I'm glad. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:18
Yeah. 
T
Taniya Richardson
59:20
So I just have a question. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
59:22
So in terms of, like, the payment and stuff, how will we, like, get access to that or receive that? Is there, like, a process? 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:30
It should be in the form of a gift card. So what I'm going to do is. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
59:33
I'm going to go. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:34
I think Yash helps me schedule this, so I'll just confirm with him that, like, we chatted and we'll process it on his. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:41
Yeah, great. 
T
To’nyia Richardson
59:43
This is a beautiful, like, idea and ab. 
T
Taniya Richardson
59:45

To’nyia Richardson

Taniya Richardson

T
To’nyia Richardson

All right, bye. 
S
Sherry Jiang
59:55
Bye.
