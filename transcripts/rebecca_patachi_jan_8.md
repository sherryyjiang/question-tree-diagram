R
Rebecca Patachi
00:24
Okay, no worries. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:26
Nice to meet you, Rebecca. I'm Sherry and I'm part of Peak. We're just doing a little bit of research to understand how people who are just a few years after graduating university are making decisions around adult decisions around, like, money. So this interview will firstly cover just a series of questions to get to know you. And then the second part will walk through, like a bit of an app that you're going to use. So, yeah, I'll give you instructions once we get to that part. Do you have any questions before we get started? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
01:02
No. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:03
Okay, awesome. So first question, just tell me a little bit more about yourself. So where you live, how old are you, and what are you doing for a living? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
01:14
Okay. My name is Rebecca from Queens, New York. I'm currently 21. I finished college in May of 2025, and right now I'm on a research grant abroad. So I'm doing research with children with autism in Romania. I'm home for the month for, like, the Christmas and holiday celebration and plan to go back in around February. February. So I wanted to do this study kind of. I think it was a week, so I wanted to do it kind of while I was still in my home. Queens, New York. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:51
Okay, gotcha. Where are you normally based if you're not in Queens? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
01:58
I am normally based in Queens. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:59
Oh, sorry, I thought you were. Okay, got it. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
02:02
I thought. Yeah, just I'm doing like a year abroad for research. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:06
Oh, okay. Got it, got it. Are you. Are you traveling to Romania at all for it or. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
02:15
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:16
Oh, okay. Oh, that's really cool. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
02:18
Okay. Yeah, got it. Go on. Yeah, no, that's about it. And I'm currently applying to med school, so that's. That's all. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:29
Okay, gotcha. And I guess, tell me, like, how you got into, I guess, your major and, like your research as well. Like, it sounds like something that you may be passionate about. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
02:43
So my major was neuroscience. I got into it kind of just being interested in different things, like being interested in science especially. And then one thing dwelt into another and it really got more towards the neuroscience side of things. I started working at a science museum when I was younger, in high school, so I always had a job and some sort of income, so now this, like, one month off is kind of throwing me off because all these years of, like, having that extra income now. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:12
Yeah. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
03:13
Okay. So I do want to better with my spending and better see, like, where things are and know how to better save. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:21
Yeah, got it. Oh, that's. That's very cool. So I guess where. So you said you finished college in May, right? Were you also doing it? Yeah, go on. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
03:37
That was at Binghamton University. I don't know if that was the question. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:40
Oh, yes. I was just wondering. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
03:43
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:44
Like, where you were at. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
03:45
Yeah, so, yeah, still in New York, but more upstate New York. Where are you based? Are you? Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
03:54
I. I'm based in the west coast, but I also live in Asia. It's kind of complicated, so. Yeah, but I'm. I'm a California native. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
04:05
Okay, nice. So we're, like, on Opposite coast, kind of. We are opposite coast. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:12
I do love. I do love New York, though. I was just there a couple months ago in November. Absolutely love it. So it's. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
04:22
It's. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:22
I. I like both coasts. It's just that I happen to be in the west coast because that's where I grew up. Yeah. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
04:30
Hi. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
04:32
So you. You said something around how, you know, you're trying to learn to get better about, like, saving and managing money. Like, can you describe a little bit of, like, what that, I guess, like, internal journey has been for you? Like, what kind of prompted that thought? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
04:50
I guess what prompted that thought was, I don't know. I don't have. Let's say, like I said, I always kind of had an inc. Or I started young, like, at 14. The minute I could work, I kind of was like, I want to always have some sort of income. And so that kind of feels like I didn't really care much about spending because I also didn't have as many expenses. But now it's starting with medical school and everything and knowing I need to have to save up as well. That kind of sparked me to be more interested in learning how to save and not only. And, like, use my money for it to grow as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:29
Yeah, got it. Well, I mean, that's great that you started working and learning how to, I guess, deal with adult money, like, at 14. I think that teaches you a lot. So. Sorry, you can't hear him, right? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
05:44
No, I barely hear. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:45
Okay, Got it. I think just making sure. Yeah. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
05:49
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
05:52
So right now, I guess when it comes to, like. So you said something about how, like, your Expenses are, like, increasing more. Like, obviously there's a part around it which is like saving a medical school. Are you also, like, covering, I guess, like more expenses in terms of like your own living expenses, like, fun budget, all of that stuff? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
06:14
Yeah, that's included as well, I guess. Like, I pay rent now there in Romania, and then I'm gonna have to start paying rent when I'm in medical school as well. So it's just more expenses that I didn't have to think about before. And now I do have to keep in mind and kind of just, I want to be a little bit more aware and a little less scared of what my future will look like. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:40
When you say like, something like you feel a little bit more scared, like what's that? Can you describe, like, when you feel that way? Is it like looking at like a bank statement at the end of the month or like, what's the. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
06:53
Yeah, like, I guess like looking at the prices of medical schools. Like, I don't know, seeing how expensive the schooling is and I don't know, I think that mostly, and then looking at my bank account and being like, there's no possible way that this can be translated or be used towards that tuition, I'm going to need to take a loan. And then that just gives me a little bit of worry because then I know interest will accumulate and paying it off and just all of that is really starting to hit me. It hit me like a truck the minute I turn 20. And. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:33
Is there anything different that you've done with, I guess, like your own management process or your lifestyle when you made that realization? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
07:46
No, not really, actually. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:48
Okay, got it. And then you said that you're already starting to pay rent in Romania, right? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
07:56
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:57
How was it like, I guess, setting up your life there? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
08:03
Yeah, I mean, I guess it was nice. It was nice that rent is not as expensive as it is here, I suppose. But yeah, that was good because I kind of got the research through Fulbright, which is both in the US and in Romania. So they were very helpful with the entire process and I went a lot smoother than I thought it would be. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:27
Okay, got it. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
08:28
Mm. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:29
Got it, got it. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
08:32
Very cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:34
So today, like, when you, I guess, kind of figure out your spending on a month to month basis, are you using any, like, spreadsheet for that or are you just checking your banking app? Like, what's your. I guess, what do you do for that right now? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
08:51
I guess just check the banking app. That's Basically what I do and just being like, oh, I spent a little bit more today, or I spent a little bit more this week and just noticing it myself, but I haven't really systematically, like, written it down or put a spreadsheet to look at it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:09
Okay, got it. Okay, so if. Let's think about, like, the last. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
09:20
Last. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:21
Month or two of spending. Can you tell me about something you spent money on that made you feel pretty good that you felt like was worth it? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
09:32
I guess things that I find worth it are like when I get a gift for someone, I guess a lot that has happened a lot. Like last month, especially in November. Getting gifts that I know someone will really appreciate and giving them, giving it to them in the holidays was something I didn't feel bad about spending money and I felt was coming to good use and was glad I did it. What did. 
S
Sherry Jiang
09:57
You can give me examples of, like, some gifts you got for people? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
10:03
Well, I got for my brother. He wanted this cologne. My mom. I also got a perfume. My dad wanted, like, some glasses with, like, some alcohol. Yeah, I guess I got, like, for my boyfriend, like a Polaroid as well as ice skates kind of things of those natures, things that I know people will use or really want. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:31
Yeah, got it. What about anything you spent money on that you felt like was worth it, but you spent it for yourself? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
10:41
Food. I really thought, like, I don't know, I guess when I come back home, I really love, like, those lunch specials because I'm pretty familiar with, like, the different places. So knowing that I spent money on food and that it's a good price to something I enjoy, especially food, like, I can't really make at home or haven't tried making at home is something I enjoy and I like doing for myself. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:07
Yeah. Oh, so these are like, lunch specials at, like, I guess, particular restaurants that you've, like, frequented before, like in your hometown? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
11:16
Yeah. So. And it was good because I was in Romania, so I wasn't able to eat those restaurants. So when I came back, they felt even tastier. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:24
Yeah. What are some of the things that you liked getting that you were like, oh, I don't know how to make this, but I love getting it on the special. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
11:35
Well, I love pho. That's my favorite dish in the whole world. And I'm not really gonna stay at home and make that. That's a lot of work. I could. I should. The amount of times I eat it, I should. Maybe. Maybe I will. I'll consider that. I love soup dumplings. So that as well. And I also love Mediterranean food, so like having like the whole branzino, lemon potatoes. I love cuisines from all over, so I love trying those. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:05
Yeah, you're speaking my language. Is very hard to make because you have to. It takes a few, I think like a long time to make the broth because they created out of like, if it's meat, it's like bone broth and stuff. But it's. Yeah, it's not easy to make, but it's very tasty. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
12:26
Yeah. And I need to find like a recipe that's good. One time, my friend, her mom is Vietnamese and she made pho and she made it with oxtail, like beef balls. Beef. She put like so much meat and I just was in heaven. I don't know. I like a really like beefy, meaty broth and it just tasted really good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:45
Oh, for sure. Like you gotta have that like richness, right? Not the, like. Oh, that's only lightly tasting. But yes, pho is amazing. Got it. And when you. When you go out to like lunch or do you usually like pick it up like I guess at home or do you like go out with like family or friends when you go there? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
13:06
I usually go out with family and friends. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:08
Okay, got it. So it seems like a lot of the spends that like you are like, I guess most happy about tend to surround around people. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
13:22
Yeah, yeah. It's pretty much every time I spend there is somebody else nearby or someone in mind. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:32
Awesome. And now let's look back like in kind of the recent months and would you be able to tell me one thing you spent money on that you like didn't think was worth it or you like maybe thought was met or maybe regretted it a bit? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
13:51
I guess maybe like a few months back I did get this foundation from Sephora. I think it was the Lady Gaga one. Yeah, I didn't really need it. I just got it because. I don't know, I. I was thinking I would take it with me to Romania, but it ended up being over the like 100ml anyway, so I just kind of left it at home and now it's just kind of staying in its box. And so that one I kind of regretted. But for the most part, most of my purchases are things I use. Just Taiwan happened not to really be one and wasn't necessary at all. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:29
What was the, I guess initial like trigger or reason to get the foundation? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
14:37
I guess the trigger was that like, I don't know, I wanted. I didn't Know what the makeup situation would really look like in Romania. So I wanted to kind of get very cute, get as much as I could from home that I knew. So I kind of just got it. But that was kind of the initial trigger, just because I was uncertain. So I bought it kind of out of uncertainty, certainty of, like, what would happen, but it wasn't necessary, and I should have looked more at it because I couldn't even have taken it with me on the plane, so. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:12
Okay, got it. Was it like a. I guess, a style that you had gotten before? Was it. It was new. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
15:19
It was actually new, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:20
Okay, gotcha. Oh, my gosh. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
15:24
Thanks. Chill. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:25
Sorry about. He's just climbing on my desk. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
15:28
You're good. Okay. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:30
All right, buddy, we're gonna go down. I'm guessing you figured out your makeup and foundation situation in Romania, then? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
15:40
Yeah, I just. Yeah, I just pretty much used concealer or whatever. Didn't really wear foundation. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:53
And then when you said, like, hey, most of my purchases are, like, things that I use, like, how do you, like, I guess, what are your, like, key things that you use or need on a day to day? And, like, how do you kind of keep track of, like, the restock for something for things like that? If you think about clothes or makeup or, like, what are the things that go into, like, making Rebecca's life run? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
16:19
I guess the things that go into making my life run was I used to like spending money on clothes, but then I kind of got over it. I don't know. It's just like, I have too many clothes. It overwhelms me. Yeah. So I kind of stopped, like, it just overwhelmed me from all the clothes I had donated a lot of them. Just felt like I didn't want to spend any more. Things I find, like, necessary or where I bought a lot of things were, like, notebooks, again, things for other people. So, like, souvenirs or gifts to give to others. Those things I kind of find myself seeing as more useful or necessary. I guess also a phone, because my phone broke down, but kind of things of that nature. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
17:02
If I need tape for something, I feel that's a little more necessary for, like, holding something together. I don't. I don't really see, like, makeup, clothes, shoes as super necessary. Sometimes, like, I do buy them, but I tend to stray more towards, like, food or things for other people and, like, simple things like notebooks, pens, tape, or things of that nature to help me with, like, studies. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:29
When did you, I guess, make that realization and shifted from, like, spending money on, like, clothes to, like, spending money on, like, people and like, practical items. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
17:42
I guess all my life I, like, spent money on both. 
S
Sherry Jiang
17:46
Yeah. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
17:47
Like practical enclose or like, ne things that weren't as necessary or I deemed not as necessary. And I guess I made that shift when I was told that I can no longer use, like, we had, like, a closet in the basement, and I was told everything be pushed up to my closet upstairs. And just seeing, like, all the things kind of shoved together made me realize how much I actually have. And I realized, wait, I actually don't really need all of this. And especially since I'm going to be traveling and moving a lot, the less clothes I have is actually better. So that happened, I guess, this summer and a little bit last year, it, like, started, but this summer really triggered me to donate, like, half of my closet. I was very fed up and done with it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:32
Yeah. So it was like this, like, visual realization. When you're moving things around, you're like, oh, my gosh, is all this stuff that, like, I kind of forgot about. But also, since you're moving, right. It's like, it kind of gets you to. It's a, I guess a moment of, like, decision making because you can't take everything with you. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
18:51
Yeah. And I guess tiredness as well. I was like, I don't want to wash all these. I don't want to do this anymore. Like, just give it away. That's it. I'm done. Yeah, but, yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:59
Yeah. Well, like, if you think back, right, like, what were the things that you used to love buying and, like, what was it like? I like to try on new perfumes and makeup brands. Like, was it like, oh, I wanted to try out new styles each season. Like, I guess if you were thinking about Rebecca, like, I don't know, a year or two or earlier, like, well, what was she like when she was thinking about, like, buying these things? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
19:27
I guess when I was with clothes, it was a lot of, like, I guess, thrifting. I don't know if maybe it was for me, really big a few years ago and all my friends were doing it. So again, the next thing I did with friends, I kind of followed along and also bought. But then I realized kind of like this year I was like, maybe they were in the thrift store for a reason because I have no reason to actually use them or, like, I'm not using them properly. So I was like, okay, maybe like, let me give them back. I guess another thing I used to love, like, trying different skin care products and Then I, like, also clean that. I guess cleaning things makes me realize how much I have of certain things. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
20:04
So I was like, okay, I need to stay away from some of these sites. Like, I'm looking any longer. It doesn't matter. I guess deals also trigger. When I see, like, oh, something's on sale, I'm like, oh, that must mean it's a good deal. I should buy it. But kind of when I saw everything in perspective and how much I have these certain things I was buying, usually I realized that I don't necessarily need them because I already have them or some variation of that sort, and there's no need to just keep adding more to it. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:36
So when you said, like, let's go back to the thrifting, I guess, example, because that's pretty interesting. So you're, like, going with, like, your friends. It's like this fun activity. Like, what were. Like, can you name one item that you remember buying while thrifting that you were like, oh, I didn't end up using it, or it didn't really fit in my life, but I got it anyways. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
21:00
I don't know. Like, I think when I was in high school, I had this obsession with sweaters. So I don't know, I just kept buying sweaters because I guess they can always fit. Like, if they're a little tighter, they're a little looser. It's. I don't know. For me, pants is a lot harder because they can appear too short, too long, or they can look big on you, but a sweater can look baggy and it looks fine or be a different color length or what. What not. And so I don't know, I just kept buying sweaters. And then over time, when I was, like, putting it all together and cleaning this summer, I was like, wait, half of my wardrobe is just white sweaters? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
21:36
Because I really like just buying white sweaters and they have just a little bit of a different pattern, but it's all basically the same thing. So I was like, maybe I'll stick with the ones I really enjoy or really like wearing often and then kind of give away others that I don't wear as often. Yeah. What. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:54
What percentage do you think you ended up wearing often versus all of the, like, let's say white sweaters that you bought. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
22:00
I mean, when I have them, I like to rotate, but I don't know. I definitely did have favorites once. I felt more and more comfortable once I were easier to style. So I guess I tried to wear each of them at least once during the season. But then the ones I really liked, I would wear maybe like, five, six, seven. No, probably more like maybe 10 to 15 times in the season. So I just kept with those and then donated the ones I would wear like, maybe once or twice. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:33
And I know it's like a totally normal thing, by the way, to, like, keep. Buy the same thing. I. I realized there's a. There's a time when floral was really popular, and I just. I did a clean and I was like, wow. Like, they look. I have 10 things that look very similar, and I, like, reflected on, like, oh, what was happening for me to do that. Like, I was wondering, like, when you were in the store, right. And you know, buying stuff like, what. What trigger, I guess what was going through your head when you saw those different white sweaters and decided to buy them? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
23:10
I guess, like, it's white. I can bleach it and it'll come out clean. So that was kind of my thinking. I don't know. But I also just like white other shaded things because I feel they match with everything as well. So it's kind of like a justification that I can clean it properly or make it come out, like, wider as well as. Oh, it would match with almost everything in my wardrobe. So it should buy because I'll have multiple occasions to wear it too, and it will be a purchase worth investing in. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:41
Yeah. Was it a little bit, like, because we all. We have consistent tastes, right? Like, we have, like, the. We like white or like, we like floral, and we can see ourselves in these different situations, I guess, in the moment. Was it like your. You liking that item is consistent, but you don't realize how many of it you have, so you just keep going back and seeing kind of the same thing and still wanting it. Right. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
24:05
Yeah, definitely got it. I agree. Yeah. I think it was my roommate, too. She was like, we're getting you away from the white section. You're not allowed in that section anymore. I was like, what are you talking about? Getting back to that section. I do not like this orange section. But yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:25
Yeah. Sometimes our friends are the ones that keep us accountable because we're, like, in denial. Right? We're like, no, we don't. We don't have, like, you know, three red dresses with the same cut. Like, no, we don't. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
24:35
Yeah, exactly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:37
Yeah. And how about I. So you mentioned you used to also love, like, trying on, like, a bunch of slick skincare products as well. So these were, like, concealers, foundations, the like. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
24:54
Yeah. And a lot of those, like, sheet Masks, peeling masks, skin care stuff too, like facial washes, moisturizer, all of those sorts. Lots of sunscreen? Yeah, lots of different sunscreens I've tried, but. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:10
Yeah, gotcha. And you were like, I guess getting these from, like, online or in person? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
25:20
Most were online because. Yeah, they're online because I guess online the. The sales were better or whatever. It be like you would buy something, they would give you a sample as well with the purchase. So that kind of enticed me to buy it more as well. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:39
Got it. So was it. Tell me if you can kind of put yourself in the past. Right? Like, so what was like the step by step? Like, was it like, hey, I'm. I have a little bit of time right now. I'm a little bored. I'm just gonna browse. Or were you like, oh, I'm running out of, like, my current sunscreen. I'm kind of curious. I want to go and see what's available. Like, what was that, like, process before you get to the site? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
26:07
Yeah, so I guess it was kind of like, oh, I'm running out of this product, so let me go to the site. I see a sunscreen. Oh, maybe this sunscreen would be good to try. And then you just see other things in the cart and you just keep adding to get that free shipping. And then you add a little bit more than you should. Or I would add a little bit more than I needed for the free shipping, but then be like, I can't get rid of this one. I can't get rid of this one. Let me just buy it. So that was kind of the process, running low on something and then just adding a bunch of other things I didn't really need. But yeah, it would just be added to the cart and purchased alongside the thing I did need. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:44
Gotcha. And so were there times where you just bought stuff and then like, oh, I didn't end up using that product that I put there. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
26:53
Yeah, I would, like, buy stuff and I guess I would try everything and not everything was suited for my skin. And I guess that's kind of. You have to try. So it wasn't too big either. Like, it wasn't too much of a, like, where you're like, I guess upsetting for me because whatever I didn't like or try. My brother is also, like, closer to my age and he liked. He didn't like purchasing things on his own, especially skincare. He thought it was like more of a girly, feminine thing to do. So he would just kind of take my left or the ones I didn't want. And sometimes I would purchase more of the things I really did like, so he would have as well. So I kind of justified it in that way too, because I was. Oh, I don't like it. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
27:35
I'll be able to give it to my brother, and I know I'll use it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:38
Yeah, I was gonna say that's very nice of you. And also, guys need skin care, too. Even if, like, they're too, like, I guess, manly to admit it. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
27:49
Yeah. I started him with, like, we started baby steps. We're almost there. We need to work him up on sunscreen, but he's almost there. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:57
Does he have. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
27:59
Yes, he does face wash and moisturizer. He does toner as well. He likes toner. Sometimes he likes serums. It's not really his thing. But the sunscreen is still a no for him. But we'll get him up to that level soon. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:14
Yeah, Total tangent. But I also feel like there's probably some, like, market, like, a business opportunity for someone to create, like, a male brand, like, because they have these dude wipes, right? And like, my boyfriend and some of my other guy friends swear by them, but I'm like, you know, you can just use, like, girl wipes. They're the same. I'm like, I'm pretty sure someone can, like, do, like, men's skin care that brands as well. Because, like, I think they are curious, but they're, like, afraid of going to their friends, guy friends, to ask, like, oh, what's retro? What's moisturizers? They'll ask, like, their girlfriends or their sisters for that kind of stuff. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
28:50
Yeah, I think that's exactly what he does. So maybe like, a marketing brand where we just make it, like, black or navy blue. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:55
Right? Exactly. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
28:58
Yeah. I think smart business move. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:01
Yeah. I'm like, something to think about. Male branded, like, skincare brand. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
29:07
Yes, exactly. No, I agree. I think it would be great. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:13
Yeah. And honestly, also, like, I think with Skincare, we said something around, like, you buy stuff, don't use it. I mean, there's. There's always like, one part of it where you just have to try what works for your skin. Because some people, everyone's skin is really different. There's also, like, you know, the threshold where, like, we're like, okay, are we just buying just to try things that we already know what we want, but we're just doing it anyways? And I think that's usually like, the part that people are more concerned about. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
29:43
Yeah, definitely. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:45
Yeah. And what just a bit more Detail. But like what sites were you using when you were I guess, browsing and looking. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
29:56
I guess like Olive Young. Yes. Style Nature Republic. I like really like the like Korean skincare. So I use those sites a lot. Mostly those sites, I guess Sephora, Ulta as well. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:11
Okay, got it. But one question. Curious about. But what made. Was it Covid that made it more like online for you when buying? Because sometimes people like to go in person to try stuff out. I'm just curious. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
30:28
I think I always preferred online just because like I could see everything. But it especially hit not necessarily when I got Covid, but when I got my own card. So then it was. This is really easy. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:42
Yeah. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
30:43
I like the card, the convenience as well. I didn't even have to go to the store. Just came in. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
30:49
Do you feel like part of it could be like the convenience of it did make you buy more than you. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
30:53
Needed as well, the convenience and as well. I don't know. Like some sites I feel if you order purchase over a certain amount or you purchase this specific product that comes with a sample, so then in your head you're like, oh, I'll get this product and then I'm getting this other thing to try for free. So it's definitely worth it. But I don't know. I guess those things are more. Are in my opinion are more clearer evident online as opposed to in person. Kind of have to seek out which one gives you a sample or they run out of samples in the store. So online, you know, they're not really running out or it will say on the site if it is. So I guess that enticed me as well. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
31:35
And then you also mentioned, you know, you'll look at deals. What could you describe maybe in the past, like examples of what you thought were like good deals that like made you want to go get something. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
31:50
I guess depends on the thing and how much I want it as well. But usually like if something's more than 50% off, I'm like, wow, that's an amazing deal. Or if it's something I really want and I know kind of never goes on sale, even seeing if it's like 10, 15% off, I will get that. Buy one, get ones, buy one, get one half off, buy one of those sort. I find pretty good deals, especially for things I know that I like, so I have more of it. I like those deals as well. So anything that's red, big and shiny, I guess. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:26
You'll be like, okay, cool. Like that. That sounds. That sounds good. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
32:30
Yeah. Pretty Much. Yeah. Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
32:37
I think that might be most of the questions on the first part. Let me just check. I guess, like, getting into the New Year, right, Because January just started. What are some things that, like, you want to do differently for yourself, both in terms of money but also just in terms of, like, more broadly in life. Right. If you were to zoom out. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
33:10
I guess for myself, I really want to pick up on Spanish. I feel I started in high school. It kind of dwindled down in college. I think I took maybe one class. But I feel especially like in the States or pretty much anywhere you go, Spanish can be very useful and helpful. So that's, I guess, my broader goal, I guess terms of spending wise goal would be I do want to travel more because I do have like that like a few more months in Romania and it's a lot more accessible to travel to different places in Europe from there because, yeah, again, the flights are cheaper as opposed to traveling from New York and shorter. So traveling is another thing I want to do for this year. And I think those were my, like, two biggest ones. 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:58
Yeah, got it. That's super exciting. I'm excited for you when you get back and are able to, like, explore. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
34:06
Yeah, thank you. What are your plans for the New Year's or what are your resolutions? 
S
Sherry Jiang
34:12
Yeah, that's a great question. I actually also want to travel more. I have not really been to the Arabic part of the world, so that's like Egypt. My best friends just went to Oman and it looked beautiful. And then I've never been to Dubai either. But I've seen the fireworks during New Year's and they look. It looks really over the top as a city and it's definitely not like, oh, beautiful nature. But I'm just so curious about, like, this society that, like, is very different than, like, you know, most places I lived. So yeah, I want to, like, travel more, but travel to places that, like, I really haven't spent that much time. What else? I think the other part is just get a little bit more time for hobbies because I really love music. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:04
But I think I always make excuses like, oh, I don't have time and all this stuff, but you make time for that. So I'm trying to figure out how to, like, balance my schedule to, like, have more time for hobbies. Then there's just a default to, like, working and then TV and like, you. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
35:23
Know, when you say music, are you referring to like, a specific instrument or. 
S
Sherry Jiang
35:30
Yeah, that's a good question. So I mean, I've been doing different kinds of music my whole life, like instruments, singing and all of that. Recently I've been doing more like DJing because it's a little less intensive for practice because I think when you're an instrumentalist or a singer, you have to keep practicing to like, have your like mechanical chops to do things. But when you're like a DJ or a producer, like, it's more of like curation and like taste kind of stuff. So you can like do like 10 hours a day and then you could also like not do it for a week and then, or like one hour here and there. So it's a little easier with a, I guess, busier adult schedule to do it. But yeah, one of my goals is to like, . 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:22
Like last year I did more because I, I had a few shows I was playing, so it was easier for me to like work towards the gigs and like prepare. But I realized like when those gigs ended that like, I just wouldn't do it as much as I wanted to. So now I'm like, maybe I should just maybe do like radio shows or do some put mixes up like on my own, even if I like don't have like a performance or like a gig lined up. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
36:45
So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:46
Yeah, that's what I mean. Nice. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
36:48
That's exciting. Very cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:50
It's fun. It keeps life interesting. Yeah. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
36:55
Awesome. 
S
Sherry Jiang
36:56
Well, I will show you what we're going to do next. Let me pull this up. Let's see. Try to check out Book Peak Money. So I just put the link in the chat. So just scroll past fireflies and you should see a link that says Book Pete Money. And then this is, I think in your instructions it did ask you to download an app, but this is actually different. We're just testing something new on the. On a web version. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
37:35
Okay. Okay. Do you want me to share the screen or. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:48
Yes, that would be great. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
37:58
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
37:58
So I guess pretend that I'm not here as you're like going through and using the app. Just like say what you're thinking out loud. Things you like, things you don't like, things that confuse you. I'll like, try to reserve my questions until like maybe at the end, but go ahead and just use it as naturally as you can. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
38:21
Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
38:26
We're using sample data here, by the way, so it won't be your actual transactions. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
38:33
Okay. Okay. So I guess this week I spent 168 and I'm happy because it's 2022. I mean 22% less than it was last week. I guess I Spent a lot of money or the bulk of my money here at Nuuly. I'm pretty proud of myself that I only spent $36 at Urban Outfitters. I usually go a lot greater than that at that store and 1336 at anthropology. I'm pretty impressed with myself for that one as well. I think it's really cool that I can get a scrapbook and it comes with pictures. So that's pretty cool. And I have this one front coffee kitchen. I seem to like this spot a lot. And yeah, with seven visits I spend around 4:47, 43. So I guess like I don't know, like let's say 6ish. 650ish dollars each time I go. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
40:13
Also like Starbucks, I can add a photo. I like that I have people so I can share and have different moments together and potentially show them as well. No patterns yet have been detected. So pretty happy about that. I'm not necessarily always going to one place. I'm trying new different things if I am going different areas. And. It seems Friday is when I went to that store and spent the most this week and then Wednesday seems to be the second runner up. So I seem. I don't know what Nuuly is but I'm assuming maybe like a shop or some restaurant. And Wednesday I also went to some shops. I guess when I go shopping I don't need my coffee as much. I'm more conscious that I'm going to be spending that day. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
41:22
So I use my coffee allowance for other days in which I know I'm not going to be shopping. And I think that's. Seems like I can tell. I spent a lot kind of in November as opposed to the other months. I'm closer to the three hundreds in these weeks in November while in December I'm closer to 200 here 150 and kind of the same in October, all under 300. So yeah, maybe November is a special month for me. Lots of birthdays or lots of celebrations for me. Anything else you want me to say or look at or go over? I think that would be pretty much it for me. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
42:15
Can you go back to the top part and then try clicking one of these responses? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
42:24
So like here? Yeah. Okay. Oh cool. I got a sticker. Alex a punk. Okay. I like the stickers. I find it very cool and also allows me to see. Sorry. Where I'm kind of spending most of my time with where and on what. I like the scrapbook. I think it's very cute. I guess I can make. I usually Go with Alex and get coffee to energize me before work. Let's say black coffee. And simplicity. I know that order. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:26
Did you notice the. Oh, sorry. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
44:29
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:30
Did you notice the stickers popping up at the top as you were. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
44:37
Alex. Coffee Ritual O and convenience. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:41
Yes. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
44:43
I guess both. 
S
Sherry Jiang
44:55
You don't have to keep going if you don't want to. It'll just keep asking you questions. I was just trying to see if you noticed as you were chatting, like, little icons would pop up at the top or it was a little harder to see. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
45:08
I did notice them. Yeah. They're nice and I like it. It keeps you, like, interactive and wants you to keep going so you can unlock, like, more stickers. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:16
Okay, got it. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
45:20
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:21
Yeah, I. I have a. I have a few questions. Like, as you were going through, do you. Do you spend, like. Do you go to coffee a lot like yourself, or. That's not really reflective of, I guess, how you spend. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
45:36
I actually don't drink coffee. 
S
Sherry Jiang
45:38
Okay, no worries. Do you have, like, a. Do you have, like, a regular treat spot, though? Like, some people, like, I guess, getting, like, teas or, like, donuts or things like that? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
45:50
I guess I do like teas. Like, I like trying different teas. So, yeah, I would say I go. Or, like. Yeah, different teaspoons. I would say I go regularly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:01
Oh, okay. Do you make it at home or do you go out to buy it? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
46:08
I. I guess, like, I make tea at home, and then when I say, like, I drink teas outside, I'm guessing, like, what I'm referring to is, like, Snapple iced tea or, like, kind of those bottled teas, if that makes sense. More like juices. I guess I do. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:25
Oh, okay. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
46:26
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:27
Got it. So you'll pick it up from, like, a. Like a 711 or grocery store? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
46:32
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
46:35
Gotcha. Do you ever. Do you ever feel. Do you ever find yourself getting those, like, I guess, like, on autopilot or do you feel like you're pretty intentional about how you spend there? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
46:56
I mean, I think I am a little on autopilot, Pilot. Because I really love the peach Snapple, like, iced tea. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:03
They are good. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
47:04
I think I. I get that a lot. Yeah. That it is a little bit of a problem. But I also don't have it in Romania, so I think that's another thing that I'm like, oh, I need to get it every day that I'm here for, like, this month before I go. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:17
Yeah, gotcha. So when do you. When would you usually get it? So, like, you're out and about and you're like, you know what? I just, like, want to take a break. Like, how does. I don't know. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
47:27
I think I love walking, so I'll go on a walk every single day. So I like going on walks when the sun's kind of still up. So. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:37
Yeah. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
47:37
And it's, like, warmer. So, like, I like going between those, like, 11 to kind of 4ish hours. So to take a break from, like, the cold, I will stop in a grocery store, get myself the tea, and keep going. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:50
Yeah, Got it. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
47:53
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
47:54
I think we all have like, our little, like, break things. Ice cream, boba tea, or, like, coffee. Yeah. And then you mentioned something interesting as well. As you're clicking through, you're like, oh, this day looks like I hypothetically, like, shopped a little bit more. So, you know, I. I didn't get coffee or tea because that is my allowance for the day. Like, do you think about that for your own money as well, that you, like, balance out each day? Like, if I spent money today on this, I won't spend money on something else. Like, is that. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
48:33
I. I guess. Yeah, that. That is something I typically do. Seeing it more, like, in front of me is a little easier to kind of do that. But I kind of try to do that on a daily basis to, like, if I'm going out to eat, then maybe I'll avoid my Snapple or, I don't know, the next day I'll cook at home or try to balance it out. So I'm not always spending money on kind of the same things. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
48:58
So do you like. I guess. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
49:03
Sorry. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:07
I think there's construction outside my window. I thought it was my cat. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
49:10
So when. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:11
When you do that, would you say it's like, more a feeling type of thing? Like, you're like, you're. Are you, like, checking your bank account when you're doing it, or you're like, you know what? I just remembered yesterday I did this. So I'm just like, adjusting based on feeling. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
49:27
It's more of a feeling. I don't really check the bank account. I kind of remember how much I spent or, like, what I did the previous day. So I'm like, okay, let's, like, take it easier today. Or I don't know. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
49:40
Yeah. And would you say it's like, kind of like one day at a time kind of thing, but it won't be like, oh, four days ago I spent here, so today I'm not gonna do this? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
49:50
Yeah, it's more of like a day by day, and let's say, like, I know a week. Oh, my friends are back from school or something. I know, like, that week I'm probably gonna spend a little more. So I'm totally okay with it. Just, like, tell myself in my head and try to keep aware of it. If I can avoid kind of, like, spending things, Money on things that I don't need, I try to do it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:11
Got it. Got it. And then you also said something when you were looking at, like, this hypothetical person's, like, Urban Outfitters, like, purchase, and you were like, oh, that's like, lower than I would expect. What made you say that? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
50:28
I mean, inflation made me say that. But genuinely, like, honestly, urban outfitters for $30, that's, like, a great start deal. I don't know what they got for $30, but I can't really find the shirt under 40 anymore. So I was very impressed with that person. Kudos to them. 
S
Sherry Jiang
50:45
Yeah. I think they probably got a candle or something, like a small thing. I agree. I'm like. I think most shirts are, like, above, like, 50 bucks at this point. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
50:58
Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, if they got a candle, then I take back my congratulations and reward to them because I don't know, I would not have spent money on a candle at Urban Outfitters. But if they got a shirt or something on sale, then some piece of clothing for that money, I'm very impressed with them. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:13
You'll be like, that was worth it. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
51:14
Good. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:15
Good job finding that steal. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
51:16
Yes, exactly. Especially at Urban Outfitters. I. I think it's a steal. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
51:21
Yeah, for sure. Any other, like, impressions as you were, like, clicking through the app? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
51:31
I like the stickers. I really like the scrapbook as well. And I really like how they kind of break it down in each week. They put it, like, in a box. I really like the design because you have, like. I like how the days are a little bit bigger, and then you're kind of brought to attention the amount that's been as well. And you kind of have the perfect amount because one page, you can kind of see from last week as well as the next week and kind of compare for almost like the month kind of what you're spending was. So I enjoy the design and aspect of that. I really like the scrapbook with the pictures. I find it very interactive, and I like the way or the things, the way they're placed. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
52:15
So, yeah, the design, I think it's very neat and nice. Makes it easier. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:20
Got it. Anything that you disliked or felt was confusing. Don't worry. You won't hurt my feelings? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
52:30
No, honestly, everything was pretty good. I, I think just personally I wouldn't chat with the chat box, but I think that's just me because I think it's a really well designed webpage and I can find everything I need kind of already there. But I'm sure if I have a question or something, I would talk to the chat box and it is nice to have. I know other people will enjoy it, but I personally really like the webpage on its own. 
S
Sherry Jiang
52:56
Got it. And then when you said like it's a personal taste that you won't use a chat as much or don't see a need for it as much, like, could you describe that a little bit more? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
53:07
I guess the only reason I say it's personal taste is because I feel I get everything I need from the webpage already. There's no. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:14
Oh, okay. 
R
Rebecca Patachi
53:15
Further detail I would need or I want kind of chat to make me like to ask me more about my spending. I kind of know like who I was with and stuff like that. But that's just a personal thing. I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy it. I just think the webpage clearly shows everything I need and I would get all the information I'm looking for, which is just kind of how much I spent this week, last week, the other weeks and what it was mostly on. 
S
Sherry Jiang
53:41
Got it, got it. Awesome. I think that's like it in terms of my questions. Thank you so much for your time and do you have any questions for me? 
R
Rebecca Patachi
53:53
I guess what does it look like here for me from now on? Because I believe it is a week. Right? Yeah, I have the app and kind of like what you. What I should be doing or is needed from you if there will be further instructions on that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
54:10
Yeah. So we'll do like a follow up, like call again. You do not. You don't have to use the app continuously for a week. But what we can do in the next session is I would, we would kind of walk through like the things that you spent money on and kind of do a similar exercise of like figuring out, okay, what was it for? What was like, I mean, similar to like what were doing but with. We were talking about your past shopping transactions, like, would focus a bit more on like, okay, what did you spend on like this particular week or this month and just walk through your thought process. 
S
