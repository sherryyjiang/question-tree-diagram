So really fine. Your patience. Where. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:05
Where are you based? 
A
Alina Khan
00:08
I'm based in New York City. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:09
Oh, okay, cool. I was actually just. 
A
Alina Khan
00:13
Yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm working here right now. I'm freshly post grad. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:18
Oh, nice. You graduated, like, I guess in the spring of this year. 
A
Alina Khan
00:24
Yeah, in May. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:25
Oh, got it. And were you living in New York as well before, or did you move to the city like you. 
A
Alina Khan
00:31
I moved to the city. I'm from North Carolina. I went to UNC Chapel Hill, so I moved postgrad for my job. 
S
Sherry Jiang
00:39
Got it, got it. And how's. How's that been going? Like, new city, New York. Super exciting. But I'm sure it's like, very hectic and very expensive as well. 
A
Alina Khan
00:47
For sure. Yeah, no, it's been going great so far. I've always wanted to move to New York. Of course, I know it comes with the chaos and everything, but I was prepared to handle it. But I think, like, I've been living here for about six months now, so I've been slowly getting used to everything. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:02
Okay, very cool. Well, it's so good to meet you and I have so many questions, but I want to just like, actually start out by just hearing a little bit more about, like, I guess, like, how you found out about the product, like, how it's been so far, and we can kind of dive into, like, specific questions there. But just so you know, like, even though I am the founder, like, you can be, like, as honest as you can with me. Like, I do not get my feelings hurt or anything. Like, we're here to try to make this, like, you know, as like, understanding and delightful as a product as possible for finances. Because, like, that's something, like, I really hated trying to figure out what to do, like, when I got started, because, like, have an accountant's brain. 
A
Alina Khan
01:45
Right. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:46
But, yeah, but love to hear your story and, like, you know how the. 
A
Alina Khan
01:52
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
01:52
Ops been. 
A
Alina Khan
01:53
Yeah, for sure. And I work in product myself, so I will give you a very, like, real raw opinion. So no worries about that. But yeah, basically the way that I found out about Peak was I myself. This is technically my first corporate job. Like, I worked an internship during college, but this is my first corporate job. So this is my first time having a real income. And I'm moving to New York City, one of the most expensive cities on the planet. And I knew that there needed to be a way for me to kind of track individually how I'm spending things. Like, I knew I had to manage my own bills, my rent, electricity, things like that. 
A
Alina Khan
02:32
But then also sometimes I know that I do get a bit carried away with eating out and shopping, depending on what season it is, things like that. So. And I know that I am constantly on my phone, I'm constantly on my laptop. So there has to be like, a good, fun, but easy way to track my expenses and actually be able to see, you know, when I'm budgeting. Like, I first turned to Excel spreadsheets and I kind of. 
S
Sherry Jiang
02:59
I'm. 
A
Alina Khan
02:59
I'm proficient enough in Excel where I can create the functions I need to track that. But then I was like, this is so boring. And it's just very repetitive. I'm not sure if I want to have to go into, like, Google Sheets and track what I'm spending and individually log every single expense too. So I turned to TikTok for, like, what are the best budgeting apps? And things like that. And so I'm sure you've heard of like, Rocket Money, the different, like, paid subscriptions. Those are the first few apps that were recommended to me. And I will say it was literally in the comment section, I think of a TikTok where someone was like, I use Peak. It's free on the App Store. All I needed to hear was that it was free. 
A
Alina Khan
03:40
So then that was when I ran to the App store, downloaded it, and then I realized, like, it uses AI to track most of your spending. So I actually really like that aspect, that all the individual expenses get, like, tagged as well and they get categorized and the fact that you had your ability to create your own categories. And for me, what I really liked about Peak was like, the user interface of the landing page, like, being able to. I really like bubbles. So being able to see, like, okay, rent is in one bubble, Shopping is in one bubble, coffee is another. Like, I really liked that. So I think that was. It made it more interactive. It made it a little more fun to be able to track my expenses. I got to see, like, okay. 
A
Alina Khan
04:24
And I also like the idea that you get to create your own categories. So for me, sometimes I will just like, instead of having a personal care plus clothing category, I'll just combine it all in one into shopping. So I was able to do that with Peak. I was able to track, like. How much I was spending on electricity every month and then also even like an investing, like, how much I was putting into my portfolio. All of that stuff. Yeah. So I really like the user interface is what drew me to Peak. And then after having it for about a month or so, I did run into a couple Roadblocks with. I guess I am assuming it. It's. 
A
Alina Khan
05:07
I'm not sure if it's like, a very new app or not, but there is a bit of, like, glitches in terms of when you're re. Categorizing things or what. Whenever I would link a new account, sometimes it would, like, restart and completely, like, get rid of all my categories and. Oh, okay, yeah, things like that. And then I found my. Like, I'm very particular about organizing, so I would have to manually go in. Okay, everything. Things like that. I'm trying to think what else. Yeah. And then sometimes when I'm trying to recategorize and like, kind of encompass like, three categories into one, it'll reverse or, you know, things like that. So most of the problems that I was facing with the app were just, like, bugs mostly, which I'm sure can be easily fixed. 
A
Alina Khan
05:58
But I think, like, one of the main reasons why I never deleted it, even after running into those problems was just, like, I really did like the interface. And I think that's just, like, what drew me to the app. And also just the fact that it was free. I didn't have to add an extra expense of subscribing to a product in order to keep track of my spending, which was the problem was that I was overspending. So. Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
06:21
Yeah. Well, thank you so much for going through that and I will definitely share the bug issue with my team to see, like, what's happening there. I have a feeling it's probably some process that's being run in the back where, like, it recognizes a new account and just, like, defaults to previous categories, which I don't think should happen, but there might be, like, something there. So I will take that back. But on that note, though, it. I would love to just understand, like, how you create meaningful categories for yourself, because it sounds to me that you've actually simplified things a bit more than, like, some of the granular ones that are more default. So I'd love to hear, like, how you personally think about your main buckets for money and why you do it that way. 
A
Alina Khan
07:07
Yeah. So for me. I kind of simplify it just for myself. Like, I am someone who actually does tend to get more granular, but I knew that if I did that with Peak, I think I would spend just too much time organizing everything into each specific category. So sometimes I like to look at it in a simple view of, like, okay, I spent this much on groceries. I didn't split it into, like, what kind of groceries, whether it was like, at home delivery versus, like, going to Trader Joe's. Like, I will just categorize it all into groceries, but then I like to differentiate groceries versus eating out. Because for me, eating out obviously adds up way more than shopping for individual ingredients at a grocery store would do. 
S
Sherry Jiang
07:52
Yeah. 
A
Alina Khan
07:53
So I think I just tailored it to be as personal as possible. Like, I set financial goals in mind. I set my own budget, like, pretty much, like, using chat GPT. I. Figure out, like, based on my annual income, this is how much I should spend every month eating out, this is how much I should spend on groceries. So just making it as personable as possible. And then also for me, like, I'm trying to think what. What other. I'm gonna open the app just to see what I have. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:26
Actually, if you don't mind, sometimes what could help is if. Do you want. If you can just like, if you don't mind, like, could you present your phone when you're going through the app? 
A
Alina Khan
08:35
Yeah. So I'm on my computer. Let me join from my. 
S
Sherry Jiang
08:39
Yeah, you just have to make sure to mute your phone and turn the volume down or else there's like, this horrendous echo that goes on Hangouts, which is awful. 
A
Alina Khan
08:49
No worries. Loading right now. Okay, I have to download the app real quick. Oh, good. But. Yeah, let me just open to see what categories I have. Yeah, so. So I also like some of the categories. Basically, the way that I categorized my spending was things that I'm aiming to cut down on. So, like, one of my categories might be nightlife, because I'm aiming to eventually cut down how much I spend, like, on drinks and going out throughout the year. So I'd like to see, like, from January to maybe June, how that differed. And then also maybe changing my budget according to the seasons. Maybe I'm not going out as much in December as I am in June when it's a lot warmer. So maybe my budget for going out in the month of December might be $100. 
A
Alina Khan
09:59
But then in June, like, in the warmer months, I might increase it to 200. Same with things like at home delivery and groceries. Maybe in the colder months, I'm doordashing more. I'm getting more what's called hungry route, like the grocery delivery service. But then in the warmer months, I'm more likely to go outside, walk, take the train to the grocery store, and then I can cut my budget down according to that. So being able to just track, like, month by month, each category, what I'm spending in has really helped me create my Budget and adjust it as needed because sometimes the budget can't always be consistent. Maybe you're spending more on winter clothes. Maybe you're spending more on summer clothes. When. One month. 
S
Sherry Jiang
10:45
Would. Let me actually show you something. Let me see if I can present this up while you're getting that. Would something. We're just like putting together some like concept testing for peak. I don't know if you see my screen. 
A
Alina Khan
11:02
Yes. 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:04
Okay. Would something like this be helpful?  basically it's like we call it a watch list because like we're trying to avoid the term like budget because sometimes like you just. You just want to monitor like roughly how much you're spending and like versus like okay, like you're doing terrible if you exceed a budget. Like that's again. But would something like this be helpful where like you set. You can kind of like flexibly put in any given month or date that you've indicated is meaningful. Like certain categories that you are like looking out for. 
A
Alina Khan
11:44
Okay, I see. So when it says like below typical, does that mean like, is this going to be like a month by month watch list or it's like a weekly. Like how does it update? 
S
Sherry Jiang
11:58
Yeah, you know what. Let me. We're gonna just try it this way. I'm just gonna try to like create a quick prototype around what I think could be useful for you. Just give me a second. Let's do it on. 
A
Alina Khan
12:15
Claude. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:19
Can you adjust this actually tell me what you would like. Let's see what comes up and maybe they'll help. 
A
Alina Khan
12:26
Based on like what I said about the I guess predictions or like. 
S
Sherry Jiang
12:30
Yeah, like month to month. I have different budgets. Sorry. I would aim for because different seasonal needs. Winter I stay in more or December. Lots of gifts. Summer equals like new clothes. I like. I think you said to track more in detail. Categories that I am trying to over time be aware of and cut down. Maybe one more descriptor and we'll just see what comes up. Think. 
A
Alina Khan
13:20
Yeah, eventually cut down. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:25
This is enough. We can also see. But. Let'S see going out. 
A
Alina Khan
13:30
Well then like maybe see like a year. A year end review of like what seasons. I. I spent more in which category. 
S
Sherry Jiang
13:40
Add a button to give me an option to check year. Instead of just only a monthly view which is the primary one here. Okay, let's just see what happens. I'm like kind of curious about like how you would visualize this. So I thought it would be. Thanks Claude for saying you love this iteration. Let's go ahead and build this prototype. Yes. Have you used Claude to do product stuff yet. 
A
Alina Khan
14:19
Okay. So I actually have not used Quad. I mostly use like I have to use company approved AI software, so I use Copilot. But I have used Quad in school and I liked it a lot. Yeah, it's. I haven't used it for prototyping yet. 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:35
Yeah. 
A
Alina Khan
14:36
Would you recommend it? 
S
Sherry Jiang
14:37
Oh, I love. Is pretty decent. Well, let's just see how decent it is when it comes up with stuff. I've been using it a lot actually in some of these kind of like conversations because I just find it easier just to like pull it up and be like, okay, is this what you're talking about? Right. 
A
Alina Khan
15:01
Yeah, for sure. Because I feel like sometimes chat GBT doesn't really do enough. Yeah. Or it just doesn't capture my vision correctly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:08
Yeah. While that is running, I mean I do still have questions. Let me see, what was the. 
A
Alina Khan
15:15
Let me also get the meeting code because I downloaded on my phone. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:19
Oh yeah. If you can. 
A
Alina Khan
15:22
Where do I find that? 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:24
Okay, I can. It's in the URL, but I can. Or you can like click on your calendar. It should pop up. 
A
Alina Khan
15:35
Oh yes, you're right. I just requested. 
S
Sherry Jiang
15:55
Okay, amazing. 
A
Alina Khan
15:59
Okay, great. I'll let you finish with the prototype and then I can share my screen. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:17
Oh, I mean it's. I don't know how long it's going to run. It might take some time too. Right there. 
A
Alina Khan
16:22
I can share now if you want. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:23
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and share. It's still running the JavaScript, so no worries. 
A
Alina Khan
16:30
Let me know when you see it. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:35
Yeah, I see it. 
A
Alina Khan
16:36
Yeah, yeah. So some of the categories I have, these are like my thing is also just really messy. 
S
Sherry Jiang
16:47
How do I. 
A
Alina Khan
16:51
Okay. Like October, I think I've like fully kind of just updated everything. So some of the categories I have like shopping, I encompass like personal care, haircuts, clothes, shopping. I put all that into shopping. Like it should be called personal spending, but I just didn't feel like naming it something that long. And then I also have food and drink, which is just like coffee, Boba, restaurants, anything. I just put that into like one category. And then groceries I have like Trader Joe's, like the grocery delivery service, H Mart, all of these things. Gifts and donations I do like if I donate to somebody like or like donate to a charity or if I buy birthday gifts for my friends. That'S what I'll usually put in gifts and donations. What I do also is like I know Venmo transactions show up in peak as well. 
A
Alina Khan
17:50
I'm like so particular with those as well, like I'll recategorize my Venmo transactions. If I'm like splitting a gift with someone. I'll take that transaction and put it into the category because I know usually they show up in transfers. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:07
Yeah. 
A
Alina Khan
18:07
So I'll like literally take them from here and then put those into the respective categories. And then also I know sometimes what people like to do is front for a restaurant bill. So I know I didn't spend 200 at a restaurant. So I will sometimes manually go in and adjust like the amount that I spent to like whatever I paid for my meal. So like very accurately gets how much I spent on food. Okay, got it. 
S
Sherry Jiang
18:39
So you manually will correct that? 
A
Alina Khan
18:41
Yeah. There was something I had thought of for like Venmo transactions specifically. I know Venmo transactions don't really get tagged into categories. I think they just get put into like the transfer out section. So I think it would be cool to with Venmo or with Zell, take the memo that was put in or like the notes, like from the notes. Use AI to like a lot. Sorry, AI logic to categorize that automatically. That would be helpful too because I usually manually have to move out every Venmo or Zelle transaction. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:21
Okay. So basically some like, smarter way to like recognize Zelle transactions of a certain type. 
A
Alina Khan
19:29
Yeah. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:30
Okay. 
A
Alina Khan
19:30
That would be cool. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
19:36
Yeah, that's super interesting. 1. This has come up a lot. I think that's a data problem that we have to basically get enough to build that. But it's definitely on our mind to do that. Like almost 80% of people we talk to have some level of spending that's like social media. Meaning like it's not just like if you have roommates, like a boyfriend or like go out with friends, like that happens. 
A
Alina Khan
20:02
Cool. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:02
Well, in the remaining time I'll just try to like flash up two things just to get your thoughts. One is the. I guess Claude finished. This is what it created. So. Yeah, so I mean like this is kind of what I was trying to get at, which is like you can create like these custom watch widgets, I guess where like, okay, now you. Instead of like, okay, there's all these categories. We just condense it into like you pin like two categories. So let's say it's shopping and going out. Then you can like see this, you're watching it and we just update it and then let's see what this happened here. Okay. I mean this is not the best, but the idea would probably be to like take all your watch list Categories and then give you some insight. But this is not that great. 
S
Sherry Jiang
20:52
I think this is probably closer to what I was trying to communicate. 
A
Alina Khan
20:55
Yeah, I actually, I was gonna say I do like the. I feel like line graphs and pie charts are always so much easier on the eyes for people to see. Like, is my spending going up or down? So I kind of like that, like, in the. In the right side, in the corner. 
S
Sherry Jiang
21:12
The ring circle charts. 
A
Alina Khan
21:13
The ring circle, yeah. And that's very, like, iOS friendly, too, because I know Apple watches, like, have the rings for exercising and stuff like that. So, yeah, having that, like, familiar design, I feel like would be really helpful. I kind of. And I also like the based off of the budget that you create. Like, the $80, it shows, like, 15 left. So that kind of shows you, like, okay, this is how much I have left to spend. That will kind of stop me. Like, if I was as the consumer, like, that would stop me from buying a new coat that I wanted, and I would be like, okay, maybe I'll wait till next month. Next month's paycheck. So I kind of like that idea. And then also, like, you mentioned widgets. 
A
Alina Khan
21:56
I honestly have not, like, customized my home screen on my iPhone enough for this. But it would be kind of cool to see, like, a. I don't know if Peak has its own widget for, like, the app screen, but seeing, like, if you have, like, a. Category where, like, it's impending, like, you have less than $50 left, it maybe, like, turns red and then it shows up in the widget, like, hey, before you make that purchase, like, just know you have $50 left remaining in your budget. Things like that. I remember, like, I think there was one time during Labor Day or a specific weekend I got, like, a funny notification from Peak about, like, oh, watch your spending this weekend. And I actually did like it. Maybe I didn't listen to it, but, like, I think it was still funny in that moment. 
A
Alina Khan
22:45
I feel like those kinds of notifications brands have always. Gone viral with those kinds of notifications too. So I feel like that would be really good for Peak, if you ever consider that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
22:56
So a bit more of like, a playful, like, roast and reminder. 
A
Alina Khan
23:00
Yeah, for sure. Rather than like a. Because I know, like, the red impending, like, and even just, like, the use of the word budget, it gets a little bit intimidating for the user. Like, no one is gonna willingly download an app that's like, you're broke. Like, you're. You know, all those things. Yeah, a playful, like, reminder or something like that. That's like, okay, that's either your choice to ignore it or to follow it. It's not like. It's like, more banter. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:29
Yeah, yeah. We're trying to find a better word to describe, but, like, I don't like the word budget either because it's, like, loaded. So I don't. We're trying to figure out the right term. We've been calling this, like, a watch list. Or, like, it could also be, like, your goal. 
A
Alina Khan
23:43
Right. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
23:44
Your goal is to hit. So it feels more like, additive. Like, oh, I completed a goal, then, like, oh, I, you know, met a budget, and I feel like I'm, like, doing less. And that doesn't feel great. But it's a branding thing because obviously I think it still helps to have a number. All right, I'm gonna show you something else. I ran this on Claude. So I actually try to take, like, some of the notes of when were talking to create, like, an insight. So we're trying to basically tune our insights to be more personalized. So it's like a mix of, like, things that we can infer from your spending, but then also, like, get you to, like, chat with the AI, to, like, share certain preferences or behavioral patterns or things like that, so it becomes more contextual. 
S
Sherry Jiang
24:34
So I'm going to show you what was produced. Again, like, you know, caveat. Some of it was literally whipped up by Claude in, like, the last, like, five minutes. So it's. It just. It's like the idea of it. So imagine this is, like, you, and this is, like something that you would get, like maybe a end of November kind of thing or. Yeah. 
A
Alina Khan
25:01
Okay. I like the identity read. I feel like it makes it more fun and more personalized. And people love horoscopes and things like that, so it kind of falls into that similar. I'm gonna just keep scrolling. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:50
Is this pace okay? 
A
Alina Khan
25:51
Yeah, yeah. Okay. 
S
Sherry Jiang
25:54
I know it's a bit long. I think the reality of it would be a lot shorter. But Claude is very verbose. So, I mean, sure, down the prompt a bit. I don't know if, like, self care gets you during holiday season, but it certainly gets me. 
A
Alina Khan
26:16
Oh, for sure. Like, for me, like, retail therapy is also my self care. So that's where it all blurs together. 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:33
I don't know if you've been to these bars, but I have. 
A
Alina Khan
26:37
I was like, did you pull up my data? 
S
Sherry Jiang
26:39
No, I didn't. 
A
Alina Khan
26:42
I saw, like, Zara return too, and I literally just returned something from Zara. I was like, wow. Yeah, the read. This is cool. Yeah, I really like the sections in the beginning. I feel like it was almost like I was breaking it down and analyzing your spending for you. And it kind of forces the user to think, like, why did I spend this much on like this, like in this specific store? I think it causes you to like reevaluate your spending choices. But then also the identity read kind of gives you a sense into what kind of person you are. You're like, oh, I spend way. I spend so much on self care and the winter I spend a lot on like, maybe something bad happened to you one week and then, you know, you spent a lot on a facial. 
A
Alina Khan
27:37
You know, like, okay, this is what I drift towards for self care. For relief. Yeah. And then just like the chart breakdown simplifies it all. 
S
Sherry Jiang
27:49
Yeah. 
A
Alina Khan
27:52
But then I like the categories you said you would watch too, because it kind of provides like self accountability in a way because it's like, you know, you should be careful about those categories. But then you still overspent or you did a good job of actually controlling impulse spending, things like that. And even like, I know impulse spending is a big thing that's noticed in budgeting, but also even like underspending, maybe even like something like a message. Because I know I used to be someone who was a big, like I was a big penny pincher at one point and I wouldn't even spend on like if I like had holes in my socks. Like sometimes I would not even buy new socks because I was like, oh, like, let me wear these down completely. 
A
Alina Khan
28:39
Maybe even like a small message of like, are you in need of a new sweater? Holiday season is coming up. Like, stock up on this, stock up on groceries, small things like that. 
S
Sherry Jiang
28:50
It kind of normalizes that, like spending isn't all about like find being good with money isn't just about not spending, but it's like exact when you need to. 
A
Alina Khan
28:59
Right, exactly. 
S
Sherry Jiang
29:00
And then obviously not spending when you don't need to. 
A
Alina Khan
29:03
Yeah. And it caters to all audiences too, because sometimes like the users who are downloading these budgeting apps aren't necessarily the ones impulse spending. Usually they're the people who are pretty smart about their money. Yeah. 
S

Okay. Yeah, I have one more quick thing to show you and get your read on if that's okay. Otherwise I think we're like almost done, but I just need to find this. Let me see if I can pull this up. Okay. I don't think we'll have a time to do the full thing, but I can at least show you conceptually. So. So what I basically showed you from the last one was like, what the insight could be. And then I think what we'll work on is backing into, like, how we can get that input. Because obviously, like, we're not going to know. We can tell like, oh, Alina returned something on Zara, but we're not going to know why, but we'll like, ask questions to. I mean, we basically will determine, okay, that's something that maybe Alina wants to know more about.

So we'll like ask that question in the app. This approach that we have here, this is not your data obviously is basically having like simplifying it down and having you review your transactions and basically like assigning like a more binary label to it. Right? Like, okay, it was something I needed. This was impulse I needed to restock. Or it was like, I felt like buying it. How helpful would you find this approach versus one that I guess would go like, maybe won't cover every single transaction, but then we'll go into some of them more in depth.

I'm trying to think like having them all listed out like this. I personally probably wouldn't take the time to like complete that. And then knowing me, I would say needed it to things that I probably didn't even need. But I think if it's like, it would be cool if like the app is noted. A repeat spending at a specific shop or like, let's say like I shopped at multiple clothing stores in a day. Maybe like one specific one will pop up and be like. I guess like answer questions about your transaction at Aritzia, like, did you need it? Like, did you need the sweater? Like the needed it versus impulse. Things like that. Maybe not as listed out like that because I think that just like creates more work for the user.

Yeah. I guess using the example of shopping, right? I mean, one option is to like simply like simplify it where like you just label it like needed or didn't. The other option would be like, let's say multiple choice of four where like, it's a bit more work to read through it, but it could be like, hey, I bought this because my friend told me to. Number two. This is part of my like daily makeup routine. I, I think Sephora, not ritzy right now, but I'll use the Sephora one because I, I think I, I just thinking about it, oh, I wanted to try like, I don't know, a new style and this is new, like, so that's like more work. Like, there's like, for you to like, kind of dissect and add that.

Whereas the other one's more simplified, where you can kind of click through, like, what, like, off the bat, like, what do you feel like you would find more useful?

I'm trying to think. I think maybe like two or three answer choices and then like an other. And then you can type in like, okay, I saw this on TikTok and I want to buy it. Or like, I saw my favorite influencer wearing this. That would give, like, I think also if you motivated the user to, like, answer that kind of survey question, because usually, like, users are not answering survey questions without reward. And then if you specifically mentioned, like, this will be included on your annual read, like, help us get to know more about you for the purpose of generating this, then people are more likely to see, like, they maybe they answered something one way in March and they don't even remember until in December.

In the read, it's brought up like, you brought this one sweater, like this thousand dollar sweater because your favorite celebrity was wearing it on the red carpet. And then it's like, do you think that was the best choice? And then you're like, you're gonna remember, like, oh, my gosh, like, why did I do that? 
S
Sherry Jiang
33:56
Yeah.

Alina Khan

So I think, like, with an incentive or reward that like this, all of this data that's gathered is going to be presented to you would make users more inclined to, like, manually input things or at least just answer. Okay, a server question.

Sherry Jiang

Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay, cool. Thanks for your time, Alina. I know went a little bit. Yeah, I guess for your time, just as like a, like a token or compensation, we can send that over to you. Just let us know if, like, Venmo or PayPal works. Just, like, reply and we can figure that out. But really appreciate the time and thanks for like, supporting the product. It means a lot.

Alina Khan
34:35
Yeah, of course. No, I really like this idea and I'd love to help out. Like, as someone who works in product, I will always give feedback because I know how hard it can be to get those people to respond for that stuff.
